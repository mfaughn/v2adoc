==== 9.2.2.18 Subject-specific Consent Text: 

Sometimes consent forms have areas where details of the procedure or information distribution that are specific to a given consent instance are recorded, i.e., a variation on a common procedure, or an explicit listing of documents to be released. As this is part of the consent document, it needs to be recorded. It is helpful to keep this information separate from the standard 'template' consent text, as in most circumstances people viewing the consent will want to know "What's different from usual?"
