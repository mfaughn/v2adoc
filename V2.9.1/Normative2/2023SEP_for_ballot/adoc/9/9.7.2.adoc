Specialized usage: Observation Identifier/Observation Sub-ID have been used as optional fields that are not required in unstructured text where the nature of the document has been identified in _TXA-2-Document type_, which is a required field, but is expressly allowed in the richer structured documentation. An example includes cases where anatomic reports may have separate OBXs for gross examination, microscopic examination, clinical impression, and final diagnosis. Another possible use includes imbedding non-textual observations within textual reports.
