==== 9.2.2.6 Consent End Date/Time: 

For most programs requiring voluntary participation, the decision to participate is not final and therefore may be revoked in the future. Therefore, when a patient makes the decision to revoke his or her consent, the date and time on which the decision was made must be recorded in order to provide a complete history of the consent. Alternatively, the initial consent may only have been granted for a limited period of time (i.e., 24 hours, 1 week, 1 year). If Consent End Date/Time is null, this should be interpreted as 'indefinite.'
