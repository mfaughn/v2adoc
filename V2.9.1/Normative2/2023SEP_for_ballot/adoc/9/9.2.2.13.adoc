==== 9.2.2.13 Consent Type:

In concert with giving consent, some programs may allow patients to request varying degrees of participation in a given program. I.e., if a consent program relates to a patient's entire medical record being available online they might have the opportunity to only reveal certain portions of that history, such as the drug history only.
