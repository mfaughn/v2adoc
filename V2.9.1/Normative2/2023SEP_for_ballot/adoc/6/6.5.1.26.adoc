Definition: This field contains the procedure code modifier to the procedure code reported in link:#ft1-25-procedure-code-cne-00393[_FT1-25 - Procedure Code_], when applicable. Procedure code modifiers are defined by regulatory agencies such as CMS and the AMA. Multiple modifiers may be reported. The modifiers are sequenced in priority according to user entry. This is a requirement of the UB and the 1500 claim forms. Multiple modifiers are allowed and the order placed on the form affects reimbursement. Refer to file:///E:\V2\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70340[_Externally-defined Table 0340 - Procedure Code Modifier_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

Usage Rule: This field can only be used if link:#ft1-25-procedure-code-cne-00393[_FT1-25 - Procedure Code_] contains certain procedure codes that require a modifier in order to be billed or performed. For example, HCPCS codes that require a modifier to be precise.

As of v 2.6, the known applicable external coding systems include those in the table below. If the code set you are using is in this table, then you must use that designation.

Level I includes the entire CPT-4 code by reference. Level II includes the American Dental Associationâ€™s Current Dental Terminology (CDT-2) code by reference. Level II also includes the genuine HCPCS codes, approved and maintained jointly by the Alpha-Numeric Editorial Panel, consisting of CMS, the Health Insurance Association of America, and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Level III are codes developed locally by Medicare carriers. The HCPCS modifiers are divided into the same three levels, I being CPT-4 modifiers, II CDT-2 and genuine HCPCS modifiers, and III being locally agreed modifiers. +

The genuine HCPCS codes and modifiers of level II can be found at http://www.hcfa.gov/stats/anhcpcdl.htm. CMS distributes the HCPCS codes via the National Technical Information Service (NTIS, http://www.ntis.gov[www.ntis.gov]) and NTIS distribution includes the CDT-2 part of HCPCS Level II, but does not include the CPT-4 part (Level I). CMS may distribute the CPT-4 part to its contractors.]
