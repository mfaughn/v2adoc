==== 6.5.6.1 IN1-1 Set ID â€‘ IN1 (SI) 00426

Definition: link:#in1-1-set-id-in1-si-00426[_IN1-1 - set ID - IN1_] contains the number that identifies this transaction. For the first occurrence the sequence number shall be 1, for the second occurrence it shall be 2, etc. The Set ID in the IN1 segment is used to aggregate the grouping of insurance segments. For example, a patient with two insurance plans would have two groupings of insurance segments. IN1, IN2, and IN3 segments for Insurance Plan A with set ID 1, followed by IN1, IN2, and IN3 segments for Insurance Plan B, with set ID 2. There is no set ID in the IN2 segment because it is contained in the IN1, IN2, IN3 grouping, and is therefore not needed. The set ID in the IN3 segment is provided because there can be multiple repetitions of the IN3 segment if there are multiple certifications for the same insurance plan, e.g., IN1 (Set ID 1), IN2, IN3 (Set ID 1), IN3 (Set ID 2), IN3 (Set ID 3)
