==== 6.5.6.36 IN1-36 Policy Number (ST) 00461

Definition: This field contains the individual policy number of the insured to uniquely identify this patient's plan. For special types of insurance numbers, there are also special fields in the IN2 segment for Medicaid, Medicare, Champus (i.e., link:#in2-6-medicare-health-ins-card-number-st-00477[_IN2-6 - Medicare Health Ins Card Number_], link:#in2-8-medicaid-case-number-st-00479[_IN2-8 - Medicaid Case Number_], link:#in2-10-military-id-number-st-00481[_IN2-10 - Military ID Number_]). But we recommend that this field (link:#in1-36-policy-number-st-00461[_IN1-36 - Policy Number_]) be filled even when the patient's insurance number is also passed in one of these other fields.
