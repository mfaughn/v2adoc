=== 17.4.3 Organization of This Chapter: Trigger Events and Message Definitions

This specification contains four functional groupings of trigger events and message definitions. The trigger events within each of the placer, filler, and query functional groupings share the same or similar message definitions.

The first functional grouping of trigger events and message definitions describes the common master file notification messages for use of the record level events for adds, deletes, updates, deactivations, and reactivations. This functional grouping is specific to the item master inventory messages.

The second functional grouping of trigger events and message definitions describes _placer request transactions_. This grouping defines the trigger events and message definitions for transactions from applications acting in a placer application role, and also defines the related filler application response messages sent back by applications fulfilling the auxiliary role. These messages are described in section _17.6_, "_Placer Application Requests and Trigger Events_."

The second functional grouping describes trigger events and message definitions for _unsolicited transactions_ from applications acting in the filler application role. This grouping describes the unsolicited messages originating from an application fulfilling the filler role, and the response messages sent back by applications fulfilling the auxiliary role. These messages are described in section _17.7_, "_Filler Application Messages and Trigger Events Unsolicited_."

The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality, and repetition of segments is described in Chapter 2, "Format for defining abstract messages."
