Definition: The state of data being sent, i.e., historic data of the cycle or a real-time snapshot of the current value of the cycle data. During a sterilization process, data is consistently being output to record the value of the data at each point in time within the instance of a cycle. For example, the temperature is recorded at every point in time during the cycle.
