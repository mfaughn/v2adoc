=== 17.5.8 ILT – Material Lot Segment

The Material Lot segment (ILT) contains material information specific to a lot within an inventory location associated with the item in the IVT segment. This segment is similar to the IIM segment used with the limited inventory item master message.

*Note:* Note that on-hand quantities do NOT refer to a continuously updated quantity. The expectation is for periodic physical inventory.
