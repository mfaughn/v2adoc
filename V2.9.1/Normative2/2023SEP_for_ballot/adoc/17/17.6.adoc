== 17.6 Placer Application Requests and Trigger Events

Placer request and filler response transactions are the messages and trigger events used between placer applications and filler applications. The placer application initiates transactions using the *SLR, STI, SDR,* or *SMD* message types, requesting information with the given trigger event message detail. The filler application responds to these requests, using the *SLS, STS, SDS,* or *SMS* message types, to either grant or deny the requests from the placer application.

When initiating a request, the placer application will generate and send a message type containing all of the information necessary to communicate the desired action to the filler application. All required segments and fields (both explicitly required and conditionally required) should be provided to the filler application, as defined in this chapter. When the filler application receives the transaction, it acknowledges it with the appropriate accept acknowledgment using an *ACK* message (assuming that the enhanced acknowledgment mode is in use).

After processing the request at the application level, the filler acknowledges the transaction with the appropriate application acknowledgment in a response message type (again assuming that an application acknowledgment was requested under the enhanced acknowledgment mode or that the original acknowledgment mode is in use). Applying the explanations of the various application acknowledgment codes in the context of this chapter, an application accept from the filler means that the request was processed and accepted by the filler.

An application error from the filler means that the request was processed and denied. An application reject from the filler means that the request was not, and could not be, processed due to one or more reasons unrelated to its content (for example, it fails the basic application protocol validation, the filler system is down, or there was an internal error).

There are no unsolicited messages initiated from a filler application defined in this set of trigger events. Those messages and trigger events are defined below, in section _17.7_, "_Filler Application Messages and Trigger Events Unsolicited_."

All of the trigger events associated with placer request and filler response transactions use the message definitions that follow:
