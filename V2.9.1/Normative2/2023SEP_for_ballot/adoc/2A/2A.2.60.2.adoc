==== 2A.2.60.2 Values (ST)

Definition: This component contains the field value or values in the form "value1& value2 & value3..."

A single-valued parameter contains only a single subcomponent in the second component, thus no subcomponent delimiters are needed (e.g., <segment field name> ^ <value>). A simple list of values (i.e., a one-dimensional array) may be passed instead of a single value by separating each value with the subcomponent delimiter (e.g., <segment field name> ^ <value1 & value2 &...>).
