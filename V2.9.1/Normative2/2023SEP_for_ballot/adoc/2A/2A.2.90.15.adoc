==== 2A.2.90.15 Called By (ST)

Definition: A "called by" name is the name that is preferred when a person is directly addressed; sometimes known as a nickname.

*Note:* The called by component contains a name that could be categorized as a nickname using the name usage types in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70200[_HL7 Table 0200 - Name type_]. Its use is reserved for instances in which the nickname is a single name part that is provided in addition to a name that has some other type, such as legal. It is understood that the "called by" name is not part of the full name. Where a nickname has more parts, possibly including a family name, a different XPN with a type of nickname should instead be used.
