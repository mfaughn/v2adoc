==== 2A.2.4.3 Channel Calibration Time Skew (NM) 

Definition: This component defines the time difference between the nominal sampling (digitization) time (which would be the same for all channels) and the actual sampling time of the channel, in seconds (or fractions thereof). This value will differ from zero when all channels in the montage are not sampled simultaneously, as occurs in systems, which sample successive channels at regular time intervals. This value may be determined from a calibration procedure in which an identical time-varying signal is applied to all channels and interchannel time differences are estimated, or more commonly it may be taken from the manufacturer’s specifications for the digitizing system used. For example, for a system which samples successive channels at regular time intervals t, the time skew of channel number n would be (n‑1)t. The actual time of sampling (digitization) of sample number m of channel number n in such a system would be R + (m-1)/f + (n-1)t, where R is the reference time at the start of the epoch and f is the channel sampling frequency (t < 1/f).
