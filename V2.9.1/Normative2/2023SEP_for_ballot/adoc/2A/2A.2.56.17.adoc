==== 2A.2.56.17 Name Context (CWE)

Definition: This component is used to designate the context in which a name is used. The main use case is in Australian healthcare: indigenous patients who prefer to use different names when attending different healthcare institutions. Another use case occurs in the US where health practitioners can be licensed under slightly different names and the reporting of the correct name is vital for administrative purposes. Refer to chapter 3, section 3.4.2.6 for more detailed information on how to use this table.
