==== 2A.2.12.4 Unit of Measure Coding System (ID)

Definition: Specifies the designated system of units. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[HL7 Table 0396 â€“ Coding System] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values. This component is required if the _CSU.2 Unit of Measure Identifier_ is present.

Both _CSU.4_ and _CSU.15_ may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in _CSU.4_ and/or _CSU.15_, the "Coding System" component or the "Coding System OID" for the tuple.
