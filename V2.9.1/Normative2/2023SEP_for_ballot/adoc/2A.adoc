== 2A.1 Purpose

The data types in this section are listed in alphabetical order.

The data type examples in this Standard are given using the standard HL7 encoding rules, with the delimiter values from Figure 2-1 of Chapter 2, "Control", section 2.5.4, "Message delimiters".

*Note:* These message construction rules define the standard HL7 encoding rules, creating variable length delimited messages. Although only one set of encoding rules has been defined as a standard since HL7 Version 2.3, other encoding rules are possible (but since they are non-standard, they may only be used by a site-specific agreement).

In this chapter, square brackets, "[" and "]", are used to specify optional parts of a string. For instance, the format of a date field is “YYYY[MM[DD]]” which denotes that the field may contain four, six, or eight characters respectively. The characters may further constrain the possible contents of the string – this will be documented at the point of use.

Definition: This data type identifies the corrections to channel sensitivity, the baseline, and the channel time skew when transmitting waveform results.

*Note:* Replaces the CM data type used in 7.14.1.5 OBX-5.3 where OBX-5 Observation value (*) is data type CD as of v 2.5.

==== 2A.2.4.0 

==== 2A.2.4.1 Channel Calibration Sensitivity Correction Factor (NM)

Definition: This component defines a correction factor for channel sensitivity, which may be derived from the last calibration procedure performed. The actual channel sensitivity is the nominal channel sensitivity given in the previous component multiplied by the unitless correction factor.

==== 2A.2.4.2 Channel Calibration Baseline (NM)

Definition: This component defines the actual channel baseline (the data value which corresponds to a nominal input signal of zero). The actual baseline may differ from the ideal because of a dc offset in the amplifier connected to the ADC. The actual baseline values for all channels (which need not be integers) may be determined at the time of calibration as the average digitized values obtained when a zero input signal is connected to each channel.

==== 2A.2.4.3 Channel Calibration Time Skew (NM) 

Definition: This component defines the time difference between the nominal sampling (digitization) time (which would be the same for all channels) and the actual sampling time of the channel, in seconds (or fractions thereof). This value will differ from zero when all channels in the montage are not sampled simultaneously, as occurs in systems, which sample successive channels at regular time intervals. This value may be determined from a calibration procedure in which an identical time-varying signal is applied to all channels and interchannel time differences are estimated, or more commonly it may be taken from the manufacturer’s specifications for the digitizing system used. For example, for a system which samples successive channels at regular time intervals t, the time skew of channel number n would be (n‑1)t. The actual time of sampling (digitization) of sample number m of channel number n in such a system would be R + (m-1)/f + (n-1)t, where R is the reference time at the start of the epoch and f is the channel sampling frequency (t < 1/f).

=== 2A.2.5 CD - channel definition

Definition: This data type is used for labeling of digital waveform data. It defines a recording channel, which is associated with one of the values in each time sample of waveform data. Each channel has a number (which generally defines its position in a multichannel display) and an optional name or label (also used in displays). One or two named waveform sources may also be associated with a channel (providing for the use of differential amplifiers with two inputs). The other components of the channel definition data type are optional. The individual components are defined as follows:

==== 2A.2.5.0 

==== 2A.2.5.1 Channel Identifier (WVI)

Definition: This component specifies the number and name of the recording channel where waveform data is transmitted.

==== 2A.2.5.2 Waveform Source (WVS)

Definition: This component identifies the source of the waveform connected to the channel. Two names may be specified if it is necessary to individually identify the two inputs for a waveform. Only one name need be specified if the channel is connected to a single input. For example, in EKG recordings typically only one name is used (such as I or II); in electroencephalography, two names are typically used, one for each input of the differential amplifier (such as F3 and C3).

==== 2A.2.5.3 Channel Sensitivity and Units (CSU)

Definition: This component defines the channel sensitivity (gain) and the units in which it is measured.

==== 2A.2.5.4 Channel Calibration Parameters (CCP)

Definition: This component identifies the corrections to channel sensitivity, the baseline, and the channel time skew.

==== 2A.2.5.5 Channel Sampling Frequency (NM)

Definition: This component defines the sampling frequency in hertz of the channel, that is, the reciprocal of the time in seconds between successive samples

==== 2A.2.5.6 Minimum and Maximum Data Values (NR)

*Note:* this is the frequency of transmitted data, which may or may not be the actual frequency at which the data was acquired by an analog-to-digital converter or other digital data source (i.e. the data transmitted may be subsampled, or interpolated, from the originally acquired data.)

Definition: This component defines the minimum and maximum data values which can occur in this channel in the digital waveform data, that is, the range of the ADC. , and also specifies whether or not non-integral data values may occur in this channel in the waveform data. If the minimum and maximum values are both integers (or not present), only integral data values may be used in this channel. If either the minimum or the maximum value contains a decimal point, then non-integral as well as integral data values may be used in this channel. For an n-bit signed ADC, the nominal baseline B = 0, and the minimum (L) and maximum (H) values may be calculated as follows:

____
L = -2n^-1^

H = 2n^-1^ - 1
____

For an unsigned n-bit ADC, the minimum value L = 0, and the nominal baseline value (B) and maximum value (H) may be calculated from the formulas,

____
B = 2n^-1^

H = 2n - 1
____

The actual signal amplitude A (for differentially amplified potential measurements, the potential at electrode number one minus that at electrode number two) may be calculated from the value D (range L to H) in the waveform data using the actual baseline value B and the nominal sensitivity S and actual sensitivity correction factor C by the formula,

____
_A = SC(D-B)_
____

*Note:* The Vocabulary TC is the steward of the CF data type.

Definition: This data type transmits codes and the formatted text associated with the code. This data type can be used to transmit for the first time the formatted text for the *canned text* portion of a report, for example, a standard radiological description for a normal chest X‑ray. The receiving system can store this information and in subsequent messages only the identifier need be sent. Another potential use of this data type is transmitting master file records that contain formatted text. This data type has six components as follows:

The components, primary and alternate, are defined exactly as in the CE data type with the exception of the second and fifth components, which are of the formatted text data type.

Example:

*Note:* The Vocabulary TC is the steward of the CNE data type.

Definition: Specifies a coded element and its associated detail. The CNE data type is used when a required or mandatory coded field is needed. The specified HL7 table or imported or externally defined coding system must be used and may not be extended with local values. Text may not replace the code. A CNE field must have an HL7 defined or external table associated with it. A CNE field may be context sensitive such that a choice of explicit coding systems might be designated. This allows for realm and other types of specificity. Every effort will be made to enumerate the valid coding system(s) to be specified in the 3rd component, however, the standards body realizes that this is impossible to fully enumerate.

*Note*: The presence of two sets of equivalent codes in this data type is semantically different from a repetition of a CNE-type field. With repetition, several distinct codes (with distinct meanings) may be transmitted.

Example 1: The drug must be coded and must be taken from the specified coding system. The coding system is an external coding system. Example is derived from _FT1-26_.

|0006-0106-58^Prinivil 10mg oral tablet^NDC|

Example 2: Consent mode must be coded and must be taken from the specified coding system. The coding system is an HL7 code table. Example is taken from _CON-10_.

|V^Verbal^HL70497^^^^2.8|

==== 2A.2.8.0 

==== 2A.2.8.1 Identifier (ST)

Definition: The first component contains the sequence of characters (the code) that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the _CNE.2_. Different coding schemes will have different elements here.

*Usage Note*: The identifier is required and must be a valid code.

==== 2A.2.8.2 Text (ST)

Definition: The second component contains the descriptive or textual name of the identifier, e.g., myocardial infarction or X-ray impression. This is the corresponding text assigned by the coding system to the identifier.

*Usage Note*: Text description of code is optional but its use should be encouraged since it makes messages easier to review for accuracy, especially during interface testing and debugging.

==== 2A.2.8.3 Name of Coding System (ID)

Definition: The third component contains the code for the name of the coding system from which the value in _CNE.1_ is obtained. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[HL7 Table 0396 - Coding Systems] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values. Each coding system is assigned a unique identifier.

As of v2.7 this component is required when _CNE.1_ is populated and _CNE.14_ is not populated. Both _CNE.3_ and _CNE.14_ may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in _CNE.3_ and/or _CNE.14_ the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.The combination of the *identifier* and *name of coding system* represent a unique concept for a data item.

Some organizations that publish code sets author more than one. The coding system, then, to be unique, is a concatenation of the name of the coding authority organization and the name of its code set or table. When an HL7 table is used for a CNE data type, the *_name of coding system_* component is defined as *_HL7nnnn_* where *_nnnn_* is the HL7 table number. Similarly, ISO tables will be named ISOnnnn, where nnnn is the ISO table number.

*Usage Note: The following statement is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.7.* Best practice would recommend that this component always be populated. However, if the field narrative explicitly states "_Refer to HL7 Table nnnn for valid values_”, and, if the sending and receiving systems are HL7 compliant, the coding system would be known from the standard. This would be similar to a field with an ID data type, except that there is a second triplet in which to express an alternate code.

==== 2A.2.8.4 Alternate Identifier (ST)

Definition: A sequence of characters that uniquely identifies an alternate code. Analogous to _CNE.1_ _Identifier_.

*Usage Notes:* The Alternate Identifier is used to represent the local or user seen code as described. If present, it obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for component 1. If both are present, the identifiers in component 4 and component 1 should have exactly the same meaning, i.e., they should be exact synonyms.

==== 2A.2.8.5 Alternate Text (ST)

Definition: The descriptive or textual name of the alternate identifier. Analogous to _CNE.2 Text_.

*Usage Notes:* If present, _CNE.5_ obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for _CNE.2_.

==== 2A.2.8.6 Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)

Definition: Identifies the coding scheme being used in the alternate identifier component. Analogous to _CNE.3 Name of Coding System_. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[HL7 Table 0396 - Coding Systems] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

As of v2.7 this component is required when _CNE.4_ is populated and _CNE.17_ is not populated. Both _CNE.6_ and _CNE.17_ may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in _CNE.6_ and/or _CNE.17_, the "Coding System" component or the "Coding System OID", for the tuple.

*Usage Notes:* If present, _CNE.6_ obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for _CNE.3_.

==== 2A.2.8.7 Coding System Version ID (ST)

Definition: the version ID for the coding system identified by _CNE.3_. It belongs conceptually to components 1-3 and appears here only for reasons of backward compatibility.

*Usage Note:* If the coding system is any system other than an "HL7 coding system," version ID must be valued with an actual version ID. If the coding system is "HL7 coding system," version ID may have an actual value or it may be absent. If version ID is absent, it will be interpreted to have the same value as the HL7 version number in the message header. Text description of code is optional but its use should be encouraged since it makes messages easier to review for accuracy, especially during interface testing and debugging.

==== 2A.2.8.8 Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)

Definition: the version ID for the coding system identified by _CNE.6_. It belongs conceptually to the group of Alternate components (see note _2A.2.1_) and appears here only for reasons of backward compatibility. Analogous to _CNE.7 Coding System Version ID_.

*Usage Notes:* If present, _CNE.8_ obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for _CNE.7_.

==== 2A.2.8.9 Original Text (ST)

Definition: The text as seen and/or selected by the user who entered the data. Original text can be used in a structured user interface to capture what the user saw as a representation of the code on the data input screen, or in a situation where the user dictates or directly enters text, it is the text entered or uttered by the user. In a situation where the code is assigned sometime after the text was entered, original text is the text or phrase used as the basis for assigning the code.

==== 2A.2.8.10 Second Alternate Identifier (ST)

Definition: A sequence of characters that uniquely identifies a second alternate code. Analogous to _CN-1 Identifier._

==== 2A.2.8.11 Second Alternate Text (ST)

Definition: The descriptive or textual name of the Second Alternate Identifier. Analogous to _CNE.2 Text._

==== 2A.2.8.12 Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)

Definition: Identifies the coding scheme being used in the Second Alternate Identifier component. Analogous to _CNE.3 Name of Coding System_. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[HL7 Table 0396 - Coding Systems] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

As of v2.7 this component is required when _CNE.10_ is populated and _CNE.20_ is not populated. Both _CNE.12_ and _CNE.20_ may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in _CNE.12_ and/or _CNE.20_, the "Coding System" component or the "Coding System OID", for the tuple.

==== 2A.2.8.13 Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)

Definition: This component carries the version for the coding system identified by components 10-12. Analogous to _CNE.7 Coding System Version ID_.

==== 2A.2.8.14 Coding System OID (ST)

Definition: This component contains the ISO Object Identifier (OID) for the coding system or value set named in _CNE.3_. The value for this component is 2.16.840.1.113883.12.#### where "####" is to be replaced by the HL7 table number in the case of an HL7 defined or user defined table. For externally defined code systems the OID registered in the HL7 OID registry SHALL be used.

*Note:* The Vocabulary TC is the steward of the CWE data type.

Definition: Specifies a coded element and its associated detail. The CWE data type is used when 1) more than one table may be applicable *or* 2) the specified HL7 or externally defined table may be extended with local values *or* 3) when text is in place, the code may be omitted.

The presence of two sets of equivalent codes in this data type is semantically different from a repetition of a CWE-type field. With repetition, several distinct codes (with distinct meanings) may be transmitted.

[#CWE_UsageNote .anchor]##*Usage Notes:* The CWE data type should be used for coded fields with one or more of the following characteristics:

____
• The identifier code (CWE.1) component is optional

• The set of allowable values from which the identifier code is drawn may be extended on a site-specific basis

• An exception identifier code may be encountered; that is, a code that is not defined in the value set (either model or site-extended).
____

This is in contrast to the CNE data type, which requires a code from a non-extendable value set be sent in the identifier code component (CNE.1) in all cases (except, of course, if the entire field is empty and defined as optional at the segment level).

The rules for populating CWE components are governed by the status of the identifier code:

[width="100%",cols="27%,24%,25%,24%",]
|===
|*Identifier Code Status* |*Identifier Code (CWE.1)* |*Descriptive Text (CWE.2)* |*Coding System (CWE.3)*
|Contained in model value set |Populated |May be populated |Must be populated with model coding system, or (not recommended) site-specific coding system that is a superset containing model values.
|Contained in site-specific extensions to model value set |Populated |May be populated |Site-specific coding system.
|Contained in neither model nor extended value sets |Not populated |May be populated with the identifier code, free-text description, or a concatenation of the two. Should be human interpretable. |Must not be populated.
|Not supplied; but descriptive text is supplied. |Not populated |May be populated with descriptive text. |Must not be populated.
|===

As an example, consider “currency” codes where:

____
• The model values are defined by the ISO 4217 value set,

• The value set is extended on site to include the code HL7 – “HL7 Drink Ticket”, and

• The data entry screen on the sending system does not enforce any edits for the currency code.
____

And so the value set used on site is:

[width="100%",cols="33%,20%,47%",]
|===
|Identifier Code Status |Identifier Code |Descriptive Text
|Model values from ISO 4217 external table |AED |United Arab Emirates, Dirhams
| |AFA |Afghanistan, Afghanis
| |ALL |Albania, Leke
| |… |
| |ZAR |South Africa, Rand
| |ZMK |Zambia, Kwacha
| |ZWD |Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Dollars
|Site-specific extension |HL7 |HL7 Events, Drink Ticket
|===

Collectively, this value set must be referred to with a local coding system ID, because “HL7” does not exist in ISO 4217. According to the rules, the site assigns the coding system ID “99CUR” to the value set.

Based on the code and descriptive text entered by the user on the sending system, the CWE would be populated as follows:

[width="99%",cols="15%,17%,20%,24%,24%",options="header",]
|===
|*Entered by user* | |*Sent in CWE* | |
|*Code* |*Descriptive Text* |*Identifier Code (CWE.1)* |*Descriptive Text (CWE.2)* |*Coding System (CWE.3)*
|GBP |Great Britain, Pound |GBP |Great Britain, Pound |ISO4217
| | |GBP |Great Britain, Pound |99CUR (This option is NOT recommended)
|HL7 |HL7 Drink Ticket |HL7 |HL7 Drink Ticket |99CUR
|XXX |<Bogus entry> |Must not be populated |XXX |Must not be populated.
| | |Must not be populated |Bogus entry |Must not be populated.
| | |Must not be populated |XXX: Bogus entry |Must not be populated.
| | |Must not be populated |anything – or nothing. |Must not be populated.
| |Dollar |Must not be populated |Dollar |Must not be populated.
| | |Valued from HL7 Table 0353 (e.g., “U” for unknown) |Dollar |HL70353
|===

Notes:

____
{empty}1. Where multiple valid options for sending the entered data exist, each alternative is depicted as a separate row.

{empty}2. _CWE.2 - Descriptive Text_ is never required, and there are no hard and fast rules on what text may be sent in this component. Of course, common sense suggests that if valued, the text should complement the identifier code of _CWE.1_.

It follows that where _CWE.1_ cannot be valued because the entered code does not exist in the value set, the entered code _may_ be sent in _CWE.2_; with or without additional descriptive text. However, this is not required by HL7.

{empty}3. The example with GBP shows two options for the code set: ISO4217 or 99CUR. While it is now technically possible to send 99CUR on the basis that this code may exist on its own in the extended local code set, HL7 urges that where a code is a member of the standard code set, that code set should be named in _CWE.3_. HL7 intends to mandate this in a future release.

{empty}4. While there are no formal rules regarding the valuation of _CWE.2 - Descriptive Text_, it is expected that any value contained therein be meaningful to a human reader.

==== 2A.2.13.2 Text (ST)

Definition: The second component contains the descriptive or textual name of the identifier, e.g., "myocardial infarction" or "X-ray impression".

==== 2A.2.13.3 Name of Coding System (ID)

Definition: The third component contains the code for the name of the coding system from which the value in _CWE.1_ is obtained. Each coding system is assigned a unique identifier. As of v2.7 this component is required when _CWE.1_ is populated and _CWE.14_ is not populated. Both _CWE.3_ and _CWE.14_ may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in _CWE.3_ and/or _CWE.14_, the "Coding System" component or the "Coding System OID" for the tuple.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[HL7 Table 0396 – Coding System] in Chapter 2C, section "Coding System Table" for valid values.

Refer to section link:#_Name_of_Coding_System (ID)[_2A.2.8.3_], "link:#_Name_of_Coding_System (ID)[_Name of Coding System (ID)_]" for a discussion of coding system conventions.

==== 2A.2.13.4 Alternate Identifier (ST)

Definition: A sequence of characters that uniquely identifies an alternate code. Analogous to _CWE.1- Identifier_.

*Usage Notes:* The Alternate Identifier is used to represent the local or user seen code as described. If present, it obeys the same rules of use and interpretation as described for component 1. If both are present, the identifiers in component 4 and component 1 should have exactly the same meaning, i.e., they should be exact synonyms.

==== 2A.2.13.5 Alternate Text (ST)

Definition: The descriptive or textual name of the alternate identifier. Analogous to _CWE.2 - Text_. See usage note in section introduction.

==== 2A.2.13.6 Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)

Definition: Identifies the coding scheme being used in the alternate identifier component. Analogous to _CWE.3 - Name of Coding System_. See usage note in section introduction.

As of v2.7 this component is required when _CWE.4_ is populated and _CWE.17_ is not populated. Both _CWE.6_ and _CWE.17_ may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the coding System as specified in _CWE.6_ and/or _CWE.17_, the "Coding System" component or the "Coding System OID", for the tuple.

==== 2A.2.13.7 Coding System Version ID (ST)

Definition: This component carries the version for the coding system identified by components 1-3. If _CWE.3_ is populated with a value other than HL7nnnn or is of table type user-defined, version ID must be valued with an actual version ID. If _CWE.3_ is populated with a value of HL7nnnn and nnnn is of table type HL7, version ID may have an actual value or it may be absent. If version ID is absent, it will be interpreted to have the same value as the HL7 version number in the message header.

==== 2A.2.13.8 Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)

Definition: This component carries the version for the coding system identified by components 4-6. Analogous To _CWE.7 - Coding System Version ID_.

|===

Definition: This data type is used for specifying an identifier with its associated administrative detail.

*Note:* The check digit and check digit scheme are null if ID is alphanumeric.

Example:

|1234567^4^M11^ADT01^MR^University Hospital|

==== 2A.2.14.0 

==== 2A.2.14.1 ID Number (ST)

Definition: The value of the identifier itself.

==== 2A.2.14.2 Identifier Check Digit (ST)

Definition: A digit, or digits, exclusive of the identifier in _CX.1_, calculated by applying an algorithm to all or some of the digits in the number, which may be used to test validity of the non-check-digit identifier.

==== 2A.2.14.3 Check Digit Scheme (ID)

Definition: Contains the code identifying the check digit scheme employed.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70061[_HL7 T__ab__le 00__61 - Check Digit Scheme_] for valid values.

The algorithm for calculating a Mod10 check digit is as follows:

Assume you have an identifier - 12345. Take the odd digit positions, counting from the right, i.e., 531, multiply this number by 2 to get 1062. Take the even digit positions, starting from the right (i.e., 42), prepend these to the 1062 to get 421062. Add all of these six digits together to get 15. Subtract this number from the next highest multiple of 10, i.e., 20 - 15 to get 5. The Mod10 check digit is 5. The Mod10 check digit for 401 is 0; for 9999, it’s 4; for 99999999, it’s 8.

The algorithm for calculating a Mod11 check digit is as follows:

*Terms*

[width="100%",cols="8%,5%,87%",]
|===
|d |= |digit of number starting from units digit, followed by 10’s position, followed by 100’s position, etc.
|w |= |weight of digit position starting with the units position, followed by 10’s position, followed by 100’s position etc. Values for w = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. (repeats for each group of 6 digits)
|c |= |check digit
|===

*Calculation*

[width="100%",cols="18%,5%,77%",]
|===
|(Step 1) m |= a|
sum of (d * w) for positions 1, 2, etc. starting with units digit

for d = digit value starting with units position to highest order

for w = weight value from 2 to 7 for every six positions starting with units digit

|(Step 2) c1 |= |m mod 11
|(Step 3) if c1 |= |0 then reset c1 = 1
|(Step 4) |= |(11 - c1) mod 10
|===

*Example:*

If the number is 1234567, then the mod 11 check digit = 4

The calculations are:

M = (7*2)+(6*3)+(5*4)+(4*5)+(3*6)+(2*7)+(1*2)

= 14 + 18 + 20 + 20 + 18 + 14 + 2

= 106

c1 = 106 mod 11

= 7

c = (11-c1) mod 10

= 4 mod 10

= 4

Other variants of these check digit algorithms exist and may be used by local bilateral site agreement.

*Note:* The check digit and code identifying check digit scheme are null if ID is alphanumeric.

==== 2A.2.14.4 Assigning Authority (HD)

The assigning authority is a unique name and/or identifierof the system (or organization or agency or department) that creates the data. As of v2.7, _CX.4 Assigning Authority_ is required if neither _CX.9_ nor _CX.10_ are populated. Best practice is to always send an OID in the Assigning Authority component

Refer to E:\\V2\\v2.9 final Nov from Frank\\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70363[_User-defined T__a__ble 0363 - Assigning Authority_] for suggested values.

The reader is referred to the _CX.9_ and the _CX.10_ if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued. If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in _CX.9_ and/or _CX.10_ conflict with _CX.4_, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.

*Note:* When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment. +
 +
By site agreement, implementers may continue to use file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 – Namespace ID_] for the first sub-component.

==== 2A.2.14.5 Identifier Type Code (ID)

A code corresponding to the type of identifier. As of v2.7, _CX.5 Identifier Type Code_ is required. Refer to E:\\V2\\v2.9 final Nov from Frank\\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70203[_HL7 Table 0203 – Identifier Type_] for suggested values.

==== 2A.2.14.6 Assigning Facility (HD)

Definition: The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the patient. This component is not an inherent part of the identifier but rather part of the history of the identifier: as part of this data type, its existence is a convenience for certain intercommunicating systems.

*Note:* When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User__-defined Table 0300 - Name__space ID_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component), may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

==== 2A.2.14.7 Effective Date (DT)

Definition: The first date, if known, on which the identifier is valid and active.

==== 2A.2.14.8 Expiration Date (DT)

Definition: The last date, if known, on which the identifier is valid and active.

==== 2A.2.14.9 Assigning Jurisdiction (CWE)

Definition: The geo-political body that assigned the identifier in component 1. As of v2.7, Assigning Jurisdiction is required if neither _CX.4_ nor _CX.10_ are populated.

• Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70399[HL7 Table 0399 – Country Code] for valid values if the administrative unit under whose jurisdiction the identifier was issued is a country.

The reader is referred to the _CX.4_ if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.

==== 2A.2.14.10 Assigning Agency or Department (CWE)

Definition: The agency or department that assigned the identifier in component 1. As of v2.7, Assigning Agency or Department is required if neither _CX.4_ nor _CX.9_ are populated.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70530[User-defined Table 0530 – Organizations&#44; agency&#44; department] for suggested values if the administrative unit under whose jurisdiction the identifier was issued is an organization, agency or department. This is populated with site-specific assigning authorities. It also should contain national or international codes when _CX.5 Identifier Type Code_ may be assigned by more than one authority within a governmental or organizational unit. For example, a federal government may have 2 departments that assign a military identifier, its Veterans Affairs department and its Department of Defense. It is *not* recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. Likewise, entries like department of motor vehicles (DMV) and licensing boards are *not* recommended for inclusion because the combination of state and identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1. This approach is not to be confused with the detailed information provided in the Chapter 15 segments that have provision for specifying the precise granting body and issuing body information needed in personnel management messages.

Example 1: <Identifier> plus <Visa> yields a unique identifier.

Example 2: <identifier> plus <state> plus <DLN> yields a unique driver’s license number.

Example 3: <identifier> plus <country> plus <INS> yields a unique immigration number.

The reader is referred to the CX.4, if there is a need to transmit this information as an OID.

==== 2A.2.14.11 Security Check (ST)

Definition: This component is used to communicate a version code that may be assigned to the value given in _CX.1 ID_.

==== 2A.2.14.12 Security Check Scheme (ID)

Definition: This component is used to transmit information intended to validate the veracity of the supplied identifier or the presenter of the identifier. For example, this component may be used to ensure that the presenter of a credit card is an authorized user of that card.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70904[HL7 Table 0904 - Security Check Scheme] for valid values.

The number of digits populated specifies the precision using the format specification YYYY[MM[DD]]. Thus:

{empty}a) only the first four digits are used to specify a precision of "year"

{empty}b) the first six are used to specify a precision of "month"

{empty}c) the first eight are used to specify a precision of "day"

Examples:

|19880704|

|199503|

The DT data type does not follow the normal truncation pattern, and the truncation character is never valid in the DT data type. Instead, the truncation behavior is based on the semantics of dates.

Unless specified in the context where the DT type is used, the DT type may not be truncated. When a DT is truncated, the truncated form SHALL still be a valid DT type. Systems should always be able to persist full dates. Refer to Chapter 2, section 2.5.5.2 "Truncation Pattern" for further information.

*Note:* Prior to v2.3, this data type was specified in the format YYYYMMDD. As of v2.3, month and days are no longer required. By site-specific agreement, YYYYMMDD may be used where backward compatibility must be maintained.

|===

Definition: Specifies a point in time using a 24-hour clock notation.

*Minimum Length:* 4

*Maximum Length:* 24

The number of characters populated (excluding the time zone specification) specifies the precision.

Format: YYYY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ].

Thus:

{empty}a) only the first four are used to specify a precision of "year"

{empty}b) the first six are used to specify a precision of "month"

{empty}c) the first eight are used to specify a precision of "day"

{empty}d) the first ten are used to specify a precision of "hour”

{empty}e) the first twelve are used to specify a precision of "minute”

{empty}f) the first fourteen are used to specify a precision of "second”

{empty}g) the first sixteen are used to specify a precision of "one tenth of a second”

{empty}h) the first nineteen are used to specify a precision of " one ten thousandths of a second”

Example: |199904| specifies April 1999.

The time zone (+/-ZZZZ) is represented as +/-HHMM offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

____
• For implementations prior to V2.9 +0000 or -0000 both represent UTC (without offset).

• For implementations starting with V2.9

o use of the plus sign (+0000) represents the civil time zone offset is known to be zero,

o use of the minus sign (-0000) represents UTC (without offset)

• This supports medical devices that are capable of sourcing UTC but do not have reference to local time offset. Use case is London in the winter.
____

*This provides a solution for the use case where the device can source UTC. It is up to the implementation to determine the storage form.*

The specific data representations used in the HL7 encoding rules are compatible with ISO 8824-1987(E).

*Note:* If the time zone is not included, the time zone defaults to that of the local time zone of the sender. Also note that a DTM valued field with the HHMM part set to "0000" represents midnight of the night extending from the previous day to the day given by the YYYYMMDD part (see example below).

|===

The HL7 Standard strongly recommends that all systems routinely send the time zone offset but does not require it. All HL7 systems are required to accept the time zone offset, but its implementation is application specific. For many applications the time of interest is the local time of the sender. For example, an application in the Eastern Standard Time zone receiving notification of an admission that takes place at 11:00 PM in San Francisco on December 11 would prefer to treat the admission as having occurred on December 11 rather than advancing the date to December 12.

*Note:* The time zone [+/-ZZZZ], when used, is restricted to legally-defined time zones and is represented in HHMM format.

One exception to this rule would be a clinical system that processed patient data collected in a clinic and a nearby hospital that happens to be in a different time zone. Such applications may choose to convert the data to a common representation. Similar concerns apply to the transitions to and from daylight saving time. HL7 supports such requirements by requiring that the time zone information be present when the information is sent. It does not, however, specify which of the treatments discussed here will be applied by the receiving system.

The DTM data type does not follow the normal truncation pattern, and the truncation character is never valid in the DTM data type. Instead, the truncation behavior is based on the semantics of dates and times.

Unless otherwise specified in the context where the DTM type is used, the DTM type may be truncated to a day. When a DTM is truncated, the truncated form SHALL still be a valid DTM type. Systems should always be able to persist full date / time information including the timezone. Refer to Chapter 2, section 2.5.5.2 "Truncation Pattern" for further information.

*Definition:* This data type transmits encapsulated data from a source system to a destination system. It contains the identity of the source system, the type of data, the encoding method of the data, and the data itself. This data type is similar to the RP (reference pointer) data type of Section _2A.2.66_, "_RP - reference pointer_," except that instead of pointing to the data on another system, it contains the data which is to be sent to that system.

==== 2A.2.24.0 

==== 2A.2.24.1 Source Application (HD) 

Definition: A unique name that identifies the system which was the source of the data. Identical format and restrictions as in reference pointer (see Section _2A.2.66.2_, "_Application ID (HD)_").

==== 2A.2.24.2 Type of Data (ID)

Definition: Identical to “type of data” component in the reference pointer (RP) data type. See Section _2A.2.66.3_, "_Type of Data (ID)_".

==== 2A.2.24.4 Encoding (ID)

Definition: The type of encoding used to represent successive octets of binary data as displayable ASCII characters. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70299[_HL7 Table 0299 - Enc__oding_] for valid values.

==== 2A.2.24.5 Data (TX)

Definition: Displayable ASCII characters which constitute the data to be sent from source application to destination application. The characters are limited to the legal characters of the ST data type, as defined in Section _2A.2.76_, "_ST - string data_," and, if encoded binary, are encoded according to the method of Section _2A.2.24.2_, "_Type of Data (ID)_".

If the encoding component (see Section _2A.2.24.4_, "_Encoding (ID)_") = "A" (none), then the data component must be scanned before transmission for HL7 delimiter characters, and any found must be escaped by using the HL7 escape sequences defined in Section 2.7 – "Use of escape sequences in text fields." On the receiving application, the data field must be de-escaped after being parsed.

If the encoding component ED.4 does not equal "A", then, after encoding, the (encoded) data must be scanned for HL7 delimiter characters, and any found must be escaped by using the HL7 escape sequences. Only then can the component be added to the HL7 segment/message. On the receiving application, the data field must be de-escaped after being parsed out of the message before being decoded. This can be expressed as "encode", "escape", "parse", "de-escape" or "decode".

|===

*Definition:* The entity identifier defines a given entity within a specified series of identifiers.

The EI is appropriate for, but not limited to, machine or software generated identifiers. The generated identifier goes in the first component. The remaining components, 2 through 4, are known as the assigning authority; they identify the machine/system responsible for generating the identifier in component 1.

The specified series, the assigning authority, is defined by components 2 through 4. The assigning authority is of the hierarchic designator (HD) data type, but it is defined as three separate components in the EI data type, rather than as a single component as would normally be the case. This is in order to maintain backward compatibility with the EI’s use as a component in several existing data fields. Otherwise, the components 2 through 4 are as defined in Section _2A.2.33_, "_HD - hierarchic designator_". Hierarchic designators (HD) are unique across a given HL7 implementation.

==== 2A.2.25.0 

==== 2A.2.25.1 Entity Identifier (ST)

Definition: The first component, <entity identifier>, is usually defined to be unique within the series of identifiers created by the <assigning authority>, defined by a hierarchic designator, represented by components 2 through 4. See Section _2A.2.33_, "_HD - hierarchic designator_".

==== 2A.2.25.2 Namespace ID (IS)

Definition: See Section _2A.2.33.1_, "_Namespace ID (IS)_" for definition. The component intentionally remains associated with the IS data type in v 2.7.

The assigning authority is a unique identifier of the system (or organization or agency or department) that creates the data. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70363[_User-defined Table 0__363 – Assigning Authority_] for suggested values.

*Note:* When the HD is used as a part of another data type, in this case as part of the EI data type, this table may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

Definition: The portion of the surname (in most Western usage, the last name) that is derived from the person's own surname, as distinguished from any portion that is derived from the surname of the person's partner or spouse. This component is optional.

If the person's surname has legally changed to become (or incorporate) the surname of the person's partner or spouse, this is the person's surname immediately prior to such change. Often this is the person's "maiden name".

*Minimum Length:* 1

*Maximum Length:*

Definition: This data type is derived from the TX data type by allowing the addition of embedded formatting instructions. These instructions are limited to those that are intrinsic and independent of the circumstances under which the field is being used. The actual instructions and their representation are described in section 2.7.6, “Usage and Examples of Formatted Text”. *_The FT field is of arbitrary length [line-through]#(up to 64k)#_* and may contain formatting commands enclosed in escape characters.

*Note:* The length restriction of 64k is retained for backward compatibility as of v2.9 and will be withdawn after two versions.

Example:

|\.sp\(skip one vertical line)|

For additional examples of formatting commands see Section 2.7, "Use of Escape Sequences in Text Fields".

To include alternative character sets, use the appropriate escape sequence. See Chapter 2, "Control", section 2.15.9.18, "Character set" and section 2.14.9.20, "Alternate character set handling scheme".

This specification applies no limit to the length of the FT data type, either here where the data type is defined, or elsewhere where the data type is used. While there is no intrinsic reason to limit the length of this data type for semantic or syntactical reasons, it is expected that some sort of limitation will be imposed for technical reasons in implementations. HL7 recommends that implementation length limits are published in implementation profiles. The contents of an FT field may be truncated, but the truncation pattern does not apply.

|===

Definition: The basic definition of the HD is that it identifies an (administrative or system or application or other) entity that has responsibility for managing or assigning a defined set of instance identifiers (such as placer or filler number, patient identifiers, provider identifiers, etc.). This entity could be a particular health care application such as a registration system that assigns patient identifiers, a governmental entity such as a licensing authority that assigns professional identifiers or drivers’ license numbers, or a facility where such identifiers are assigned.

The HD is designed to be a more powerful and more general replacement for the application identifier of HL7 versions 2.1 and 2.2. It adds two additional components, the <universal ID> and the <universal ID type> to the former application ID (which is renamed more generically to be the namespace ID).

In the case where an HD identifies an entity that assigns/creates instance identifiers such as a particular patient registration system, it defines an "assigning authority". In the case where an HD identifies a location where instance identifiers are given out (although they may be created by another entity at another location) such as a particular "department of motor vehicles office location," it defines an "assigning facility". These two different uses of the HD appear in many of the extended data types.

The "assigning authority" defined by the HD is similar in its role to the coding system (and version) part of the coded element data types: both identify a set of more discrete instance identifiers. The difference is that the set of HD-defined discrete instances contain identifiers of "real-world" things such as patient or clinical orders, while the coded element-defined set of discrete instances contains concept identifiers (codes).

The HD is designed to be used either as a local identifier (with only the <namespace ID> valued) or a publicly-assigned identifier, a UID (<universal ID> and <universal ID type> both valued). Syntactically, the HD is a group of two identifiers: a local identifier defined by the first component and a universal identifier defined by the second and third components. HDs that have defined third components (defined UID types) must have a second component that is unique within the series of IDs defined by that component.

*Note:* The HD is used in fields that in earlier versions of HL7 used the IS data type. Thus, a single component HD (only the first component valued) will look like a simple IS data type for older systems expecting a single component in the place of the HD data type.

If the first component for the HD data type is present, the second and third components are optional. If the third component is present, then the second must also be present (although in this case the first is optional). The second and third components must either both be valued (both non-null), or both be not valued (both null).

This means that if all three components of the HD are valued, the entity identified by the first component is the same as the entity identified by components two and three taken together. However, implementers may choose, by site agreement, to specify that if all three components of the HD are valued, the first component defines a member in the set defined by the second and third components.

Examples:

Example 1: ISO example with only the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ components valued:

|^2.16.840.1.113883.19^ISO|

The syntax of the second component is defined by the ISO standard for object identifiers, not by HL7 (for which the second component is of the ST data type). Thus the periods (".") in the second component are part of the ISO syntax, and are legal by the definition of the HL7 ST data type.

Example 2: A UUID example

|^478A0114-EBF0-7701-A023-6841FF05731A^UUID|

Example 3: A DNS example

|^falcon.iupui.edu^DNS|

*Local examples:*

Example 4: Local use only: a HD that looks like an IS data type

|LAB1|

|RX.PIMS.SystemB.KP.CA.SCA|

Note that the syntax of the first component is not defined by HL7 but by the site according to its own needs: the only requirement is that the first component’s structure is allowed by the HL7 string (ST) data type, which is used for values by the IS data type.

Example 5: Local identifier using components 2 and 3 only _[.underline]#(Deprecated as of v2.8 and will be withdrawn in V2.10)#_

|^RX.PIMS.SystemB.CA.SCA^M|

An alternate way to encode the previous example, illustrating the use of the third component value of "M" (see file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70301[_HL7 Table 0301 - Universal ID type_] below) to identify a locally-defined identifier set. The second component has the same value as the previous example but is now defined to be a member of a set of allowable values defined by a site for the identifier set “M”. _[.underline]#The use of local coding schemes as Universal ID Types is deprecated as of v 2.8; assigning authorities should be identified with true Universal IDs.#_

Example 6: local identifier and universal ID types:

|LAB1^2.16.840.1.113883.19.1.2.3.3.4.6.7^ISO|

A HD with an ISO "object Identifier" as a UID and a locally defined system name. Both the first component and the second and third (taken together) refer to the same entity. This example shows that the local value and the universal ID value may be transmitted with a single HD field.

==== 2A.2.33.0 

==== 2A.2.33.1 Namespace ID (IS)

Definition: The local coded item for the entity. The component intentionally remains associated with the IS data type in v 2.7.

file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID_] is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component.

*Note:* When the HD is used in a given segment (either as a field or as a component of another data type) this table may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

==== 2A.2.33.2 Universal ID (ST)

Definition: The HD’s second component, <universal ID> (UID), is a string formatted according to the scheme defined by the third component, <universal ID type> (UID type). The UID is intended to be unique over time within the UID type. It is rigorously defined. Each UID must belong to one of the specifically enumerated schemes for constructing UIDs (defined by the UID type). The UID (second component) must follow the syntactic rules of the particular universal identifier scheme (defined by the third component).

*Note:* These syntactic rules are not defined within HL7 but are defined by the rules of the particular universal identifier scheme (defined by the third component).

==== 2A.2.33.3 Universal ID Type (ID)

Definition: The third component governs the interpretation of the second component of the HD. If the third component is a known UID refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70301[_HL7 Table 0301 - Universal_ _ID type_] for valid values, then the second component is a universal ID of that type.

Definition: The value of such a field follows the formatting rules for an ST field except that it is drawn from a table of legal values. There shall be an HL7 table number associated with ID data types. An example of an ID field is _OBR-25 Result Status_. This data type should be used only for HL7 tables (see Chapter 2C, section 2.C.1.2, "HL7 Tables"). The reverse is not true, since in some circumstances it is more appropriate to use the CNE or CWE data type for HL7 tables.

The minimum and maximum lengths are specified in the context in which the ID data type is used. The longest HL7 defined legal value is 15 characters, but there are a few circumstances where the legal values are taken from code systems defined by other bodies (such as IANA mime types).

*Note:* The Vocabulary TC is the steward of the IS data type.

*Minimum Length:* ≥ 1- Varies - dependent on length of shortest code in code set.

*Maximum Length:* Varies - dependent on length of longest code in code set.

As of v2.7, the only approved use of the IS data type is in the _HD.1_, _EI.2_ and _PL.6_ plus a limited number of fields where a determination could not readily be made as to whether the item is an identifier or an actual coded item. Additionally, in accordance with chapter 2 rules, any field or data type component marked as "Retained for backward compatibility" will retain any IS data type.

The value of such a field follows the formatting rules for a ST field except that it is drawn from a site-defined (or user-defined) table of legal values. There shall be an HL7 table number associated with IS data types. An example of an IS field is the Event reason code defined in Chapter 3, "Patient Administration", section 3.4.1.4, "Event reason code". This data type should be used only for user-defined tables (see Chapter 2C, "Code Tables", section 2.C.1.1, "User-defined Tables"). The reverse is not true, since in some circumstances, it is more appropriate to use the CWE data type for user-defined tables.

|... | | | | | | | |
|===

Definition: This data type is used to represent channel-multiplexed waveform data. Assuming that fields that utilize this data type repeat and that Y represents the specific repetition, the components of the repetition will reflect sample Y from each channel.

*Usage Note:* The MA data type is preferred when the signal recording device outputs the waveform data by time (all signal amplitudes at time sample 1, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 2, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 3, etc.). The typical count is 32, 64, or 128 channels. At the time of this writing, the MA data type is the one used by most commercial EEG instruments, while other electrophysiological instruments (such as evoked potential instruments) may use the NA data type. The MA data type is the "natural" one for multi-channel EEG instruments since the signal acquisition process involves digitizing each channel in succession as rapidly as possible, then after a fixed interval (like 0.004 seconds) digitizing all the channels again in succession, and repeating this every 0.004 seconds as long as the recording continues.

Conversion of one format to another is often not possible or desirable in near-real-time applications. For example, a long-term EEG recording may go on for 24, 48, 72, or more hours and implementations cannot wait until the recording is ended to transmit the data because physicians need to review the waveforms as the recording is in progress; this is why it only makes sense to organize the data by the MA data type which sends the data one time sample after the next.

Note that, visually, the NA and MA data types are indistinguable: they both appear as a series of numeric components. They are distinguished by context, particularly when used in _OBX.5_ where the data type is specified in _OBX.3_.

Use Case: Commercial EEG instruments

Definition: This data type is used to represent a series (array) of numeric values. A field of this type may contain a one-dimensional array (vector or row) of numbers. Also, by allowing the field to repeat, a two-dimensional array (table) of numbers may be transmitted using this format, with each row of the table represented as one repetition of the field. Arrays that have one or more values not present may be transmitted using this data type. "Not present" values are represented as two adjacent component delimiters. If the absent values occur at the end of a row, the trailing component delimiters may be omitted. If an entire row of a table has no values, no component delimiters are necessary (in this case, there will be two adjacent repetition delimiters).

|===
|SEQ |LEN |C.LEN |DT |OPT |TBL# |COMPONENT NAME |COMMENTS |SEC.REF.
| |1..16 | | | | |Numeric | |
|===

Definition: A number represented as a series of ASCII numeric characters consisting of an optional leading sign (+ or -), the digits and an optional decimal point. In the absence of a sign, the number is assumed to be positive. If there is no decimal point the number is assumed to be an integer.

*Minimum Length:* 1

*Maximum Length:* 16

Examples:

|999|

|-123.792|

|0.1|

Values of this data type shall contain at least one digit to the left of the decimal point. This means that 0.1 is a valid representation, while .1 is not. Leading zeros, or trailing zeros after a decimal point, are not significant. For example, the following two values with different representations, "01.20" and "1.2," are identical. Except for the optional leading sign (+ or -) and the optional decimal point (.), no non-numeric ASCII characters are allowed. Thus, the value <12 should be encoded as a structured numeric (SN) (preferred) or as a string (ST) (allowed, but not preferred) data type.

The NM data type does not follow the normal truncation pattern, and the truncation character is never valid in the NM data type. Instead, the truncation behavior is based on the semantics of numbers.

Values of type NM may always have leading zeros truncated. Note that HL7 recommends that leading zeros not be used. Unless NM is used to represent a monetary amount, implementations may truncate trailing zeros after the decimal point up to the first non-zero digit or the decimal point, which ever comes first. Any digits to the left of the decimal point may never be truncated (other than leading zeros).

Example: 1.0200 may be truncated to 1.02, but not to 1.0.

This data type is the equivalent of an XCN data type joined with a DTM data type. However, the XCN data type has been flattened to allow legal expression of its embedded complex data types HD, CWE and CWE.

==== 2A.2.56.0 

==== 2A.2.56.1 Person Identifier (ST)

Definition: This component carries the Person Identifier itself. _PPN.1_, in conjunction with _PPN.9_, uniquely identifies the entity/person.

==== 2A.2.56.2 Family Name (FN) 

Definition: This component allows full specification of the surname of a person. Where appropriate, it differentiates the person's own surname from that of the person's partner or spouse, in cases where the person's name may contain elements from either name. It also permits messages to distinguish the surname prefix (such as "van" or "de") from the surname root. See section _2A.2.30_, "link:++#a.2.30-fn---family-name++[_FN – Family Name_]".

==== 2A.2.56.3 Given Name (ST)

Definition: First name.

==== 2A.2.56.4 Second and Further Given Names or Initials Thereof (ST)

Definition: Multiple middle names may be included by separating them with spaces.

==== 2A.2.56.5 Suffix (ST)

Definition: Used to specify a name suffix (e.g., Jr. or III).

==== 2A.2.56.6 Prefix (ST)

Definition: Used to specify a name prefix (e.g., Dr.).

==== 2A.2.56.7 Degree 

*Attention: _The PPN.7 component was deprecated as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v2.7_* See _PPN.22 - Professional Suffix_.

==== 2A.2.56.8 Source Table (CWE)

*Attention*: Retained for backwards compatibility only as of v2.7 and withdrawn in V2.9. The reader is referred to _PPN.9_ instead.

==== 2A.2.56.9 Assigning Authority (HD)

Definition: The assigning authority is a unique identifier of the system (or organization or agency of department) that creates the data. It is a HD data type. file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70363[_User-defined Table 0363 – Assigning Auth__ority_] is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for the first sub-component of the HD component, <namespace ID>.

*Note:* When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Name__space ID_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

By site agreement, implementors may continue to use file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 – Name__space ID_] for the first sub-component.

*Attention:* _As of v 2.7, the Assigning Authority is conditional._ It is required if _PPN.1_ is populated and neither _PPN.23_ nor _PPN.24_ are populated. All 3 components may be populated. No assumptions can be safely made based on position or sequence. Best practice is to send an OID in this component when populated.

The reader is referred to the _PPN.23_ and the _PPN.24_ if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued. If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in _PPN.23_ and/or _PPN.24_ conflict with _PPN.9_, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.

==== 2A.2.56.10 Name Type Code (ID)

Definition: A code that represents the type of name. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70200[_HL7 Table 0__200 - Nam__e Type_] for valid values (see Section _2A.2.90_, “_XPN - extended person name_”).

==== 2A.2.56.11 Identifier Check Digit (ST)

Definition: A digit, or digits, exclusive of the identifier in _CX.1_, calculated by applying an algorithm to all or some of the digits in the number, which may be used to test validity of the non-check-digit identifier.

==== 2A.2.56.12 Check Digit Scheme (ID)

Definition: Contains the code identifying the check digit scheme employed.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70061[_HL7 Table_ _0061 - Check Digi__t Scheme_] for valid values.

==== 2A.2.56.13 Identifier Type Code (ID)

Definition: A code corresponding to the type of identifier. In some cases, this code may be used as a qualifier to the "Assigning authority" component. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70203[_HL7 Table 0203 - Identifier Typ__e_] for suggested values.

==== 2A.2.56.14 Assigning Facility (HD)

Definition: The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the patient. This component is not an inherent part of the identifier but rather part of the history of the identifier: as part of this data type, its existence is a convenience for certain intercommunicating systems.

*Note:* When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Namesp__ace I__D_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

==== 2A.2.56.15 Date/Time Action Performed (DTM)

This component describes when the activity was performed.

*Note:* If this field is not null, both the performing person and the time stamp must be valued.

==== 2A.2.56.16 Name Representation Code (ID)

Definition: Different name/address types and representations of the same name/address should be described by repeating of this field, with different values of the Name/Address Type and/or Name/Address Representation component.

*Note:* This new component remains in “alphabetic” representation with each repetition of the field using these data types. That is, even though the name may be represented in an ideographic character set, this component will remain represented in an alphabetic character set.

In general this component provides an indication of the representation provided by the data item. It does not necessarily specify the character sets used. Thus, even though the representation might provide an indication of what to expect, the sender is still free to encode the contents using whatever character set is desired. This component provides only hints for the receiver, so it can make choices regarding what it has been sent and what it is capable of displaying.

==== 2A.2.56.17 Name Context (CWE)

Definition: This component is used to designate the context in which a name is used. The main use case is in Australian healthcare: indigenous patients who prefer to use different names when attending different healthcare institutions. Another use case occurs in the US where health practitioners can be licensed under slightly different names and the reporting of the correct name is vital for administrative purposes. Refer to chapter 3, section 3.4.2.6 for more detailed information on how to use this table. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70448[_User-__defined Table 0448 – Name Context_] for suggested values.

==== 2A.2.56.18 Name Validity Range

*Attention:* _The PPN.18 component was deprecated as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7._ Refer to link:#a.2.56.20-effective-date-dtm[_PPN.20 Effective Date_] and link:#a.2.56.21-expiration-date-dtm[_PPN.21 Expiration Date_].

==== 2A.2.56.19 Name Assembly Order (ID)

Definition: A code that represents the preferred display order of the components of this person name. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70444[_HL7 Table 0444 – Name Ass__embl__y Order_] for valid values.

==== 2A.2.56.20 Effective Date (DTM)

Definition: The first date, if known, on which the person name is valid and active.

==== 2A.2.56.21 Expiration Date (DTM)

Definition: The last date, if known, on which the person name is valid and active.

==== 2A.2.56.22 Professional Suffix (ST)

Definition: Used to specify an abbreviation, or a string of abbreviations, denoting qualifications that support the person’s profession, (e.g., licenses, certificates, degrees, affiliations with professional societies, etc.). The Professional Suffix normally follows the Family Name when the Person Name is used for display purposes. Please note that this component is an unformatted string and is used for display purposes only. Detailed information regarding the contents of Professional Suffix is obtained using appropriate segments in Chapter 15, "Personnel Management".

==== 2A.2.56.23 Assigning Jurisdiction (CWE)

Definition: The geo-political body that assigned the identifier in component 1.

See section _2A.2.14.9_, "_Assigning Jurisdiction (CWE)_" for further detail.

==== 2A.2.56.24 Assigning Agency or Department (CWE)

Definition: The agency or department that assigned the identifier in component 1.

See section _2A.2.14.10_, "_Assigning Agency or Department (CWE)_" for further details.

==== 2A.2.56.25 Security Check (ST)

Definition: This component is used to communicate a version code that may be assigned to the value given in _PPN.1 - Person Identifier_.

==== 2A.2.56.26 Security Check Scheme (ID)

Definition: This component is used to transmit information intended to validate the veracity of the supplied identifier or the presenter of the identifier. For example, this component may be used to ensure that the presenter of a credit card is an authorized user of that card.

Refer to _file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70904[HL7 Table 0904 - Security Check Scheme]_ for valid values.

|===

Definition: Uniquely identifies the parent result’s OBX segment related to the current order, together with the information in _OBR-29 - Parent_.

*Usage Note:* This data type is applied only to _OBR-26 - Parent Result_ where it serves to make information available for other types of linkages (e.g., toxicology). This important information, together with the information in _OBR-29 - Parent_, uniquely identifies the parent result’s OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result that identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization.

We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.

This field is present only when the parent result is identified by _OBR-29 - Parent_ and the parent spawns child orders for each of many results. See Chapter 7, "Observations", for more details about this linkage.

*Note:* Replaces the CM data type used in sections 4.5.3.26 - OBR-26 and 7.4.1.26 - OBR-26 as of v 2.5.

==== 2A.2.57.0 

==== 2A.2.57.1 Parent Observation Identifier (CWE)

Definition: Contains the unique identifier of the parent observation as defined in the _OBX-3_ of the parent result. The value is the same as the _OBX-3_ of the parent.

==== 2A.2.57.2 Parent Observation Sub-identifier (ST)

Definition: Contains the sub-ID of the parent result as defined in the _OBX-4_ of the parent result. The value is the same as the _OBX-4_ of the parent.

==== 2A.2.57.3 Parent Observation Value Descriptor (TX)

Definition: Contains a descriptor of the parent observation value as specified in the _OBX-5_ of the parent result.

As an example, the third component may be used to record the name of the microorganism identified by the parent result directly. The organism in this case should be identified exactly as it is in the parent culture.

|===

*Definition:* This data type contains a segment field name and the list of values to be passed to the query processor.

Example:

|@PID.5.1^EVANS|

==== 2A.2.60.0 

==== 2A.2.60.1 Segment Field Name (ST)

Definition: This component contains the segment field name.

Naming conventions:

Segment field names are designated by the “@” symbol concatenated with the HL7 segment ID followed by the sequence number for the field separated by a period. See sections 2.5.2, "Segments and segment groups" and 2.5.3.1, "Position (sequence within the segment)" for a definition of segment ID and sequence number. If the field is divided into components, the designation may be suffixed with ".nn", to identify a particular component (a suffix of “.3” indicates the third component of the field); otherwise, the whole field is assumed. If the field is further divided into subcomponents, the designation is suffixed with “.nn.mm", which identifies the component and subcomponent requested by relative position.

Site-specific segment field names may be used**.** In this case, the site-specific segment ID (if the field is not being added to an existing HL7 segment) and the sequence number must be defined so that they do not conflict with existing HL7 segment IDs and field sequence numbers.

Values for this field are defined in the function-specific chapters of this specification.

*Note:* If the “@” is being used as one of the delimiter characters defined in MSH-2-encoding characters, it must be “escaped.” See Section 2.7.1, "Formatting Codes".

==== 2A.2.60.2 Values (ST)

Definition: This component contains the field value or values in the form "value1& value2 & value3..."

A single-valued parameter contains only a single subcomponent in the second component, thus no subcomponent delimiters are needed (e.g., <segment field name> ^ <value>). A simple list of values (i.e., a one-dimensional array) may be passed instead of a single value by separating each value with the subcomponent delimiter (e.g., <segment field name> ^ <value1 & value2 &...>).

The relational conjunction is defined as follows: If more than one comparison is to be made to select qualifying rows, a conjunction relates this repetition of the field to the next.

• When applied to strings, the relational operators LT, GT, LE, and GE imply an alphabetic comparison.

• A "generic" comparison selects a record for inclusion in the response when the beginning of the designated field matches the select string.

• Where a repeating field is specified as an operand, a match on any instance of that field qualifies the row for inclusion in the response message.

• AND takes precedence over OR. More sophisticated precedence rules require that the query be expressed as an embedded query language message or a stored procedure query message (see Chapter 5, "Query").

Definition: Describes a reference range and its supporting detail.

*Note:* Replaces the CM data type used in sections 8.8.4.6 - OM2-6, 8.8.4.7 - OM2-7 and 8.8.4.8 - OM2-8 as of v 2.5.

Examples:

{empty}a) A range that applies unconditionally, such as albumin, is transmitted as:

|3.0&5.5|

{empty}b) A normal range that depends on sex, such as Hgb, is transmitted as:

|13.5&18^M~12.0 & 16^F|

{empty}c) A normal range that depends on age, sex, and race (a concocted example) is:

|10&13^M^0&2^^^B11&13.5^M^2&20^^^B~12&14.5^M^20&70^^^B~13&16.0^M^70&^^^B|

When no value is specified for a particular component, the range given applies to all categories of that component. For example, when nothing is specified for race/species, the range should be taken as the human range without regard to race. If no age range is specified, the normal range given is assumed to apply to all ages.

==== 2A.2.63.0 

==== 2A.2.63.1 Numeric Range (NR)

Definition: This component specifies the numeric interval of the reference data. Range is taken to be inclusive (i.e., the range includes the end points). Units are context sensitive and are defined in the usage note for the field where this data type is used.

==== 2A.2.63.2 Sex (CWE)

Definition: This component specifies the clinically relevant sex for which the reference range is valid. This may be the Sex Parameter for Clinical Use concept (refer to _file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70001[User-defined Table 0828 –Sex] Parameter for Clinical Use_ in Chapter 2C for suggested values) or some other representation of a clinically relevent sex. For backwards compatibility purposes only, implementers may also refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70001[_User-defined Table 0001 – Administrative Sex_] in Chapter 2C for additional valuesBecause multiple tables may potentially be used in this component, inclusion of the Name of the Coding System component of the CWE data type is critical so that the receiving system can appropriately interpret the received code.

==== 2A.2.63.3 Age Range (NR)

Definition: This component specifies the age range for which the reference range is valid. Ages of less than one year should be specified as a fraction (e.g., 1 month = 0.0830, 1 week = 0.01920, 1 day = 0.0027300). However, for most purposes involving infants, the gestational age (measured in weeks) is preferred. The lower end of the range is not indicated; the upper end is, assuring that series of ranges do not overlap.

==== 2A.2.63.4 Gestational Age Range (NR)

Definition: This component specifies the gestational age range for which the reference range is valid. Gestational age is relevant only when the reference range is influenced by the stage of pregnancy. The gestational age is measured in weeks from conception. For example, |1&4| implies that the normals apply to gestational ages from 1 week to 4 weeks inclusive. The lower end of the range is not included; the upper end is, assuring that series of age ranges do not overlap.

==== 2A.2.63.5 Species (TX)

Definition: This component specifies the species for which the reference range is valid. Species is assumed to be human unless otherwise stated. Example values are rabbit, mouse, and rat.

==== 2A.2.63.6 Race/subspecies (ST)

Definition: This component specifies the race or subspecies for which the reference range is valid. In the case of humans (the default species), the race is specified when race influences the reference range. When normal ranges for animals are being described, this component can be used to describe subspecies or special breeds of animals.

==== 2A.2.63.7 Conditions (TX)

Definition: This component specifies any arbitrary condition for which the reference range is valid. This may include such conditions as phase of menstrual cycle or dose of a particular drug. It is provided as a way to communicate the normal ranges for special conditions. It does not allow automatic checking of these text conditions.

Definition: The repeating frequency with which the treatment is to be administered. It is similar to the frequency and SIG code tables used in order entry systems.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70335[_User-de__fined Table 0335 - Repeat Pattern_] for suggested values.

The first component may repeat, with repeat values separated by a space. The repeats are interpreted as connected by logical ANDs.

Example:

Twice per day, every other day: BID QOD

Three times per day, Monday Wednesday and Friday: TID QJ135

Because of this syntax, repeat values should never contain blanks.

==== 2A.2.64.2 Explicit Time Interval (ST)

Definition: This component explicitly lists the actual times referenced by the code in the first component, in the following format: HHMM,HHMM,HHMM,.... This second component will be used to clarify the first component in cases where the actual times vary within an institution. If the time of the order spans more than a single day, this new component is only practical if the same times of administration occur for each day of the order. If the actual start time of the order (as given by the fourth component of the quantity/timing field) is after the first explicit time, the first administration is taken to be the first explicit time after the start time. In the case where the patient moves to a location having a different set of explicit times, the existing order may be updated with a new quantity/timing field showing the changed explicit times.

Example: 2nd component of quantity/timing field:

*Definition:* This data type transmits information about data stored on another system. It contains a reference pointer that uniquely identifies the data on the other system, the identity of the other system, and the type of data.

==== 2A.2.66.0 

==== 2A.2.66.1 Pointer (ST)

Definition: A key to the referenced data assigned by the system that stores the data. The key, which is an ST data type, is used to identify and access the data, either as an object identifier, or as a hierarchical name or query string.

==== 2A.2.66.2 Application ID (HD)

Definition: A unique designator of the system that stores the data. It is an HD data type (See Section _2A.2.33_, "_HD - hierarchic designator_"). Application ID’s must be unique across a given HL7 implementation.

*Usage Note:* The Application ID together with the Pointer may form a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) in accordance with RFC 2396. In this case the Application ID shall include the Scheme and Authority parts of the URI, and the Path part if that points to an application. The Pointer shall include the Query part of the URI, or the Path part if that points to an object. All delimiters between URI parts (“:”, “/”, “?”) should be included in the components.

Referenced data may be obtained by a mechanism not defined in the HL7 standard. The Scheme part of a URI in the Application ID specifies the access protocol, e.g., HTTP or FTP.

*Example 1:* A CDA document accessed by FTP:

____
|/cdasvc/u28864099/s9076500a/e77534/d55378.xml^&ftp://www.saintelsewhere.org&URI^text^x-hl7-cda-level-one|
____

*Example 2:* A DICOM image accessed by HTTP and converted to JPEG (using the ISO/DICOM WADO standard);

*Note:* the ampersands in the Pointer string are escaped to “\T\” to avoid conflict with the sub-component delimiter:

|===

Definition: The repeat pattern data type should be used where it is necessary to define the frequency at which an event is to take place. This data type provides a way to define repeat pattern codes "on the fly". The repeat pattern code is equivalent to the TQ data type, component 2, sub-component 1 (repeat pattern). The additional components define the meaning of the repeat pattern code. Components 2 - 10 are used to define relatively simple repeat patterns. Component 11 is provided to define complex repeat patterns. This data type forms a bridge between the 2.x Repeat Pattern concept from Quantity/Timing, and the Version 3.0 GTS General Timing Specification. Component 1 is the 2.x concept of repeat pattern. Components 2-7 are derived from the version 3.0 data type PIVL. Components 8-10 are derived from the version 3.0 EIVL data type. If a repeat pattern cannot be defined using components 2-10, then component 11, General Timing Specification is provided. This allows the full literal form of the version 3.0 GTS to be specified.

When using the RPT, if an application doesn't recognize the code in component 1, then it may attempt to determine the appropriate frequency using the remaining components. If the application does recognize the code in component 1, the application is not required to determine the frequency from the remaining components.

*Use Case*: The use case supporting this proposal is the need to define repeat patterns on the fly while placing an order. The TQ data type did not have the capability to define the meaning of a repeat pattern on the fly. To get around this problem, vendors have implemented a variety of solutions to solve this issue. One way was to add Z-components to the TQ data type to transmit information about the repeat pattern. Another solution was to attempt to parse the repeat pattern code in an attempt to decipher what the code meant.

|Q1H&Every 1 Hour&HL7xxx^^^^1^h|

*Definition:* The structured numeric data type is used to unambiguously express numeric clinical results along with qualifications. This enables receiving systems to store the components separately, and facilitates the use of numeric database queries. The corresponding sets of values indicated with the <comparator> and <separator/suffix> components are intended to be the authoritative and complete set of values. If additional values are needed for the <comparator> and <separator/suffix> components, they should be submitted to HL7 for inclusion in the Standard.

If <num1> and <num2> are both non-null, then the separator/suffix must be non-null. If the separator is "-", the data range is inclusive; e.g., <num1> - <num2> defines a range of numbers x, such that: <num1> <=x<= <num2>.

|SEQ |LEN |C.LEN |DT |OPT |TBL# |COMPONENT NAME |COMMENTS |SEC.REF.
| | | | | | |String Data | |
|===

*Definition*: The String data type is used for text data when the appearance of text does not bear meaning. This is true for formalized text, symbols and formal expressions, and all kinds of names intended for machine processing (e.g., sorting, querying, indexing, etc.).

String data is left justified (i.e., no leading blank space) with trailing blanks optional, which may be trimmed, and SHOULD be ignored on string compare operations for 2 values of type ST. Any displayable (printable) characters are allowed based on the character set identified in MSH-18. For the default ASCII character set this is hexadecimal values between 20 and 7E, inclusive, or decimal values between 32 and 126, except the defined escape characters and defined delimiter characters. For Unicode this is any code point with a Basic Type of Graphic or Format , except the defined escape characters and defined delimiter characters; see The Unicode Standard section 2.4 <http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/ch02.pdf> for details.

*Example* *1*: A textual ST field:

|almost any data at all|

*Example 2*: URL encoded in an ST component:

^http://www.pacs.poupon.edu/wado.jsp^

*Example 3*: ISO OID encoded in an ST subcomponent:

&2.16.840.1.113883.1.1&

To include any HL7 delimiter character (except the segment terminator) within a string data field, use the appropriate HL7 escape sequence (see Section 2.7.1, "Formatting Codes”).

*Minimum Length*: Not specified for the type. May be specified in the context of use. Defaults to 1

*Maximum Length*: Not specified for the type. May be specified in the context of use

ST has no inbuilt semantics – these are assigned where the ST is used. In each case where ST is used, minimum, maximum, and conformance lengths may be specified. Unless specified in the context of use, values of type ST may not be truncated.

*Usage note:* The ST data type is intended for short strings (e.g., less than 1000 characters). For longer strings the TX or FT data types should be used (see Sections _2A.2.80_, “_TX - text data_” or _2A.2.31_, “_FT - formatted text data_”).

*Alternate character set note:* ST - string data may also be used to express other character sets. See Section 2.15.9.18, "Character set," and Section 2.15.9.20, "Alternate character set handling" for details.

=== 2A.2.77 TM – time

|===
|SEQ |LEN |C.LEN |DT |OPT |TBL# |COMPONENT NAME |COMMENTS |SEC.REF.
| |2..16 |13# | | | |Time | |
|===

*Definition:* Specifies the hour of the day with optional minutes, seconds, fraction of second using a 24-hour clock notation and time zone.

As of v 2.3, the number of characters populated (excluding the time zone specification) specifies the precision.

Format: HH[MM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]

Thus:

{empty}a) the first two are used to specify a precision of "hour”

{empty}b) the first four are used to specify a precision of "minute”

{empty}c) the first six are used to specify a precision of "second”

{empty}d) the first eight are used to specify a precision of "one tenth of a second”

{empty}e) the first eleven are used to specify a precision of " one ten thousandths of a second”

Example: |0630| specifies 6: 30 AM.

The fractional seconds could be sent by a transmitter who requires greater precision than whole seconds. Fractional representations of minutes, hours or other higher-order units of time are not permitted.

*Note:* The time zone [+/-ZZZZ], when used, is restricted to legally-defined time zones and is represented in HHMM format.

The time zone of the sender may be sent optionally as an offset from the coordinated universal time (previously known as Greenwich Mean Time). Where the time zone is not present in a particular TM field but is included as part of the date/time field in the MSH segment, the MSH value will be used as the default time zone. Otherwise, the time is understood to refer to the local time of the sender.

Examples:

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",]
|===
|Time |Description
|\|0000\| |midnight
|\|235959+1100\| |1 second before midnight in a time zone eleven hours ahead of Universal Coordinated Time (i.e., East of Greenwich).
|\|0800\| |Eight AM, local time of the sender.
|\|093544.2312\| |44.2312 seconds after Nine thirty‑five AM, local time of sender.
|\|13\| |1pm (with a precision of hours), local time of sender.
|===

Prior to v 2.3, this data type was specified in the format HHMM[SS[.SSSS]][+/-ZZZZ]. As of v 2.3 minutes are no longer required. By site-specific agreement, HHMM[SS[.SSSS]][+/-ZZZZ] may be used where backward compatibility must be maintained.This corresponds a minimum length of 4.

The TM data type does not follow the normal truncation pattern, and the truncation character is never valid in the TM data type. Instead, the truncation behavior is based on the semantics of times.

Unless otherwise specified in the context where the DTM type is used, the DTM type may be truncated to a particular minute. When a TM is truncated, the truncated form SHALL still be a valid TM type. Refer to Chapter 2, section 2.5.5.2, "Truncation Pattern", for further information.

|SEQ |LEN |C.LEN |DT |OPT |TBL# |COMPONENT NAME |COMMENTS |SEC.REF.
| | | | | | |Text Data | |
|===

*Definition:* String data meant for user display (on a terminal or printer). Such data would not necessarily be left justified since leading spaces may contribute greatly to the clarity of the presentation to the user. Because this type of data is intended for display, it may contain certain escape character sequences designed to control the display. Escape sequence formatting is defined in Section 2.7, "Use of escape sequences in text fields". Leading spaces should be included. Trailing spaces should be removed.

Example:

| leading spaces are allowed.|

Since TX data is intended for display purposes, the repeat delimiter, when used with a TX data field, implies a series of repeating lines to be displayed on a printer or terminal. Therefore, the repeat delimiters are regarded as paragraph terminators or hard carriage returns (e.g., they would display as though a CR/LF were inserted in the text (DOS type system) or as though a LF were inserted into the text (UNIX style system)).

A receiving system would word‑wrap the text between repeat delimiters in order to fit it into an arbitrarily sized display window but start any line beginning with a repeat delimiter on a new line.

To include alternative character sets, use the appropriate escape sequence. See Chapter 2, section 2.14.9.18, "MSH-18 - Character Set" and section 2.14.9.20, "MSH-20 - Alternate Character Set Handling Scheme".

This specification applies no limit to the length of the TX data type, either here where the data type is defined, or elsewhere where the data type is used. While there is no intrinsic reason to limit the length of this data type for semantic or syntactical reasons, it is expected that some sort of limitation will be imposed for technical reasons in implementations. HL7 recommends that implementation length limits be published in implementation profiles.

|===

*Definition:* This data type specifies the address of a person, place or organization plus associated information.

*Note:* Replaces the AD data type as of v2.3.

Example of usage for US:

|1000 Hospital Lane^Ste. 123^Ann Arbor ^MI^99999^USA^B^^WA^|

This would be formatted for postal purposes as

1000 Hospital Lane

Ste. 123

Ann Arbor MI 99999

Example of usage for Australia:

|14th Floor^1000 Hospital Lane^Sidney^QLD^9999|

This would be formatted for postal purposes using the same rules as for the American example as

14th Floor

1000 Hospital Lane

Sidney QLD 9999

*International note:* Countries typically have a standard method of formatting addresses. This data type does not specify the formatting usages, only the components of a postal address.

==== 2A.2.87.0 

==== 2A.2.87.1 Street Address (SAD)

Definition: This component contains the house number, apartment number, street name, street direction, P.O. Box number, and similar address information.

==== 2A.2.87.2 Other Designation (ST)

Definition: This component contains the second line of address. In US usage, it qualifies address. Examples: Suite 555 or Fourth Floor. When referencing an institution, this component specifies the street address.

==== 2A.2.87.3 City (ST)

Definition: This component specifies the city, or district or place where the addressee is located depending upon the national convention for formatting addresses for postal usage.

==== 2A.2.87.4 State or Province (ST)

Definition: This component specifies the state or province where the addressee is located. State or province should be represented by the official postal service codes for that country.

==== 2A.2.87.5 Zip or Postal Code (ST)

Definition: This component specifies the zip or postal code where the addressee is located. Zip or postal codes should be represented by the official codes for that country. In the US, the zip code takes the form 99999[-9999], while the Canadian postal code takes the form A9A9A9, and the Australian Postcode takes the form 9999.

==== 2A.2.87.6 Country (ID)

Definition: This component specifies the country where the addressee is located. HL7 specifies that the 3-character (alphabetic) form of ISO 3166 be used for the country code. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70399[_HL7 Table_ _0399 – Count__ry Code_] for valid values.

==== 2A.2.87.7 Address Type (ID)

Definition: This component specifies the kind or type of address. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70190[_HL7 Ta__ble 0190 - A__ddress Type_] for valid values.

_XAD.7_ is required if there are multiple occurrences of XAD in a field.

==== 2A.2.87.8 Other Geographic Designation (ST)

Definition: This component specifies any other geographic designation. It includes county, bioregion, SMSA, etc.

==== 2A.2.87.9 County/Parish Code (CWE)

Definition: A code that represents the county in which the specified address resides. file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70289[_User-defined Table 0289 - County/parish_] is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component. When this component is used to represent the county (or parish), component 8 <other geographic designation> should not duplicate it (i.e., the use of <other geographic designation> to represent the county is allowed only for the purpose of backward compatibility, and should be discouraged in this and future versions of HL7).

Allowable values: codes defined by government.

==== 2A.2.87.10 Census Tract (CWE)

Definition: A code that represents the census tract in which the specified address resides. file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70288[_User-defined Table 0288 - Census Tract_] is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component.

Allowable Values: codes defined by government.

==== 2A.2.87.11 Address Representation Code (ID) 

Definition: Different <name/address types> and representations of the same name/address should be described by repeating of this field, with different values of the <name/address type> and/or <name/address representation> component.

*Note:* Also note that this new component remains in "alphabetic" representation with each repetition of the fields using these data types. I.e. even though the address may be represented in an ideographic character set, this component will remain represented in an alphabetic character set.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70465[_HL7 Table 0465 – Name/address Representatio__n_] for valid values.

In general this component provides an indication of the representation provided by the data item. It does not necessarily specify the character sets used. Thus, even though the representation might provide an indication of what to expect, the sender is still free to encode the contents using whatever character set is desired. This component provides only hints for the receiver, so it can make choices regarding what it has been sent and what it is capable of displaying.

==== 2A.2.87.12 Address Validity Range (DR)

*Attention:* _The XAD.12 component was retained for backward compatibility as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v2.7._ Refer to _2A.2.87.13_, "_Effective Date_ (DTM)" and _2A.2.87.14_, "_Expiration Date_ (DTM)" components.

==== 2A.2.87.13 Effective Date (DTM)

Definition: The first date, if known, on which the address is valid and active for the ‘owning’ entity.

==== 2A.2.87.14 Expiration Date (DTM)

Definition: The last date, if known, on which the address is valid and active for the ‘owning’ entity.

==== 2A.2.87.15 Expiration Reason (CWE)

Definition: This identifies why this address was marked as "ended". Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70616[User-defined Table 0616 – Address Expiration Reason] for valid values.

==== 2A.2.87.16 Temporary Indicator (ID)

Definition: If "Y" this indicates that the address is considered temporary. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70136[_HL7 Table 0136 – Yes/No Indicator_].

==== 2A.2.87.17 Bad Address Indicator (ID)

Definition: If "Y", this indicates that it is not possible to contact the "owning" entity at this address. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70136[_HL7 Table 0136 – Yes/No Indicator_].

==== 2A.2.87.18 Address Usage (ID)

Definition: This indicates how the address is intended to be used. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70617[_User-defined Table 0617 – Address Usage_] for valid values.

==== 2A.2.87.19 Addressee (ST)

==== 2A.2.87.20 Comment (ST)

Definition: Descriptive information about the use of the address.

Example: "Do not ring bell."

==== 2A.2.87.21 Preference Order (NM)

Definition: For an entity having multiple addresses, indicates which is the 'most preferred' (lowest number) to 'least preferred' (highest number).

If the preference order is unique across all usages for a given type, then it indicates the preference across all usages, (e.g., first try my home address, then my business address). Otherwise, the preference order is assumed to only apply within a specific usage.

Preference order numbers need not be sequential (i.e., four addresses with the priority orders of 10, 1, 5 and 15 are legitimate). The preference order numbers must be non-negative.

==== 2A.2.87.22 Protection Code (CWE)

Definition: Identifies that an address needs to be treated with special care or sensitivity.

The specific set of codes and appropriate handling of such addresses will vary by jurisdiction and is subject to site-specific negotiation. For example, a provider address marked as 'unlisted' might not be printed in an internal address listing. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70618[_User-defined Table 0618 – Protection Code_] for valid values.

==== 2A.2.87.23 Address Identifier (EI)

Definition: A unique identifier for the address.

This component allows an address to be uniquely identified, and enables the linking of a single address to multiple people and contexts. For example, each member of a family living at the same location would share the same address, having the same identifier. A correction to the address of one family member could be automatically propagated to other members of the family.

*Note:* Replaces CN data type as of v 2.3.

This data type is used extensively appearing in the PV1, ORC, RXO, RXE, OBR and SCH segments, as well as others, where there is a need to specify the ID number and name of a person.

Example without assigning authority and assigning facility:

|1234567^Everyman^Adam^A^III^DR^^ADT01^^L^4^M11^MR|

Examples with assigning authority and assigning facility:

Dr. Harold Hippocrates’ provider ID was assigned by the Provider Master and was first issued at Good Health Hospital within the Community Health and Hospitals System. Since IS table values (first component of the HD) were not used for assigning authority and assigning facility, components 2 and 3 of the HD data type are populated and demoted to sub-components as follows:

12188^Hippocrates^Harold^H^IV^Dr^^^&Provider Master.Community Health and Hospitals&L^L^9^M10^DN^&Good Health Hospital.Community Health and Hospitals&L^A

Ludwig van Beethoven's medical record number was assigned by the Master Patient Index and was first issued at Fairview Hospital within the University Hospitals System.

==== 2A.2.88.0 

==== 2A.2.88.1 Person Identifier (ST)

Definition: This component carries the Person Identifier itself. XCN.1, in conjunction with XCN.9 uniquely identifies the entity/person.

_XCN.1_ is required if _XCN.2_ is not populated. Both may be populated.

==== 2A.2.88.2 Family Name (FN) 

Definition: This component allows full specification of the surname of a person. Where appropriate, it differentiates the person's own surname from that of the person's partner or spouse, in cases where the person's name may contain elements from either name. It also permits messages to distinguish the surname prefix (such as "van" or "de") from the surname root. See section _2A.2.30_, "_FN - family name_".

_XCN.2_ is required if _XCN.1_ is not populated. Both may be populated.

==== 2A.2.88.3 Given Name (ST)

Definition: First name.

==== 2A.2.88.4 Second and Further Given Names or Initials Thereof (ST) 

Definition: Multiple middle names may be included by separating them with spaces.

==== 2A.2.88.5 Suffix (ST)

Definition: Used to specify a name suffix (e.g., Jr. or III).

==== 2A.2.88.6 Prefix (ST) 

Definition: Used to specify a name prefix (e.g., Dr.).

==== 2A.2.88.7 Degree 

*Attention:* _The XCN-7 component was deprecated as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v27.._ Refer to _XCN.21 Professional Suffix._

==== 2A.2.88.8 Source Table (CWE)

*Attention*: _Retained for backwards compatibility only as of v 2.7_. The reader is referred to _XCN.9_ instead.

file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70297[_User-de__fined Table 0297 – CN ID_] source is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for this component. Used to delineate the first component.

==== 2A.2.88.9 Assigning Authority (HD)

Definition: The assigning authority is a unique identifier of the system (or organization or agency of department) that creates the data. file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70363[_User-defined Table 0363 – Assig__ning Authority_] is used as the HL7 identifier for the user-defined table of values for the first sub-component of the HD component, <namespace ID>.

As of v 2.7, the Assigning Authority is conditional. It is required if _XCN.1_ is populated and neither _XCN.22_ nor _XCN.23_ are populated. All 3 components may be populated. No assumptions can be safely made based on position or sequence. Best practice is to send an OID in this component when populated.

The reader is referred to _XCN.22_ and _XCN.23_ if there is a need to transmit values with semantic meaning for an assigning jurisdiction or assigning department or agency in addition to, or instead of, an assigning authority. However, all 3 components may be valued. If, in so doing, it is discovered that the values in _XCN.22_ and/or _XCN.23_ conflict with _XCN.9_, the user would look to the Message Profile or other implementation agreement for a statement as to which takes precedence.

*Note:* When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Namespa__ce I__D_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

By site agreement, implementors may continue to use file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 – Namespace ID_] for the first sub-component.

==== 2A.2.88.10 Name Type Code (ID)

Definition: A code that represents the type of name. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70200[_HL7 Table 0200 - Nam__e Type_] for valid values. See Section _2A.2.90.7_, "_Name Type Code (ID)_".

As of v 2.7, _XCN.10_ is conditional. It is required if _XCN.2_ is populated.

==== 2A.2.88.11 Identifier Check Digit (ST)

Definition: This component contains the digit, or digits, exclusive of the identifier in _XCN.1_, calculated by applying an algorithm to all or some of the digits in the number, which may be used to test validity of the non-check-digit identifier.

==== 2A.2.88.12 Check Digit Scheme (ID)

Definition: Contains the code identifying the check digit scheme employed.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70061[_HL7 T__able 0061 - Check Digit Scheme_] for valid values.

==== 2A.2.88.13 Identifier Type Code (ID)

Definition: A code corresponding to the type of identifier. In some cases, this code may be used as a qualifier to the <assigning authority> component. Refer to E:\\V2\\v2.9 final Nov from Frank\\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70203[_HL7 Table 0203 - Identifier Type_] for suggested values.

As of v 2.7, _XCN.13_ is conditional. It is required if _XCN.1_ is populated.

==== 2A.2.88.14 Assigning Facility (HD)

Definition: The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the person. This component is not an inherent part of the identifier but rather part of the history of the identifier: as part of this data type, its existence is a convenience for certain intercommunicating systems.

*Note:* When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 - Nam__espace ID_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.

==== 2A.2.88.15 Name Representation Code (ID)

Definition: Different <name/address types> and representations of the same <name/address> should be described by repeating of this field, with different values of the <name/address type> and/or <name/address representation> component.

*Note:* This new component remains in “alphabetic” representation with each repetition of the field using these data types. I.e., even though the name may be represented in an ideographic character set, this component will remain represented in an alphabetic character set.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70465[_HL7 Table 0465 – Name/address Representation_] for valid values.

In general this component provides an indication of the representation provided by the data item. It does not necessarily specify the character sets used. Thus, even though the representation might provide an indication of what to expect, the sender is still free to encode the contents using whatever character set is desired. This component provides only hints for the receiver, so it can make choices regarding what it has been sent and what it is capable of displaying.

==== 2A.2.88.16 Name Context (CWE)

Definition: This component is used to designate the context in which a name is used. The main use case is in Australian healthcare for indigenous patients who prefer to use different names when attending different healthcare institutions. Another use case occurs in the US where health practitioners can be licensed under slightly different names and the reporting of the correct name is vital for administrative purposes. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70448[_User-defined Table 0448 – Name Context_] for suggested values.

==== 2A.2.88.17 Name Validity Range 

*Attention:* _The XCN.17 component was deprecated as of v2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7._ Refer to _XCN.19 Effective Date_ and _XCN.20 Expiration Date_ instead.

This component contains the start and end date/times that define the period during which this name was valid.

==== 2A.2.88.18 Name Assembly Order (ID)

Definition: A code that represents the preferred display order of the components of this person name. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70444[_HL7 Table 0444 - Name Assembly Order_] for valid values.

*Note:* Replaces PN data type as of v 2.3.

*Internationalization Note:* In countries using ideographic or syllabic (phonetic) character sets, it is sometimes necessary to send the name in one or both of these formats, as well as an alphabetic format. The switching between the different character sets can be accomplished using a character set such as JIS X 0202 - ISO 2022 which provides an escape sequence for switching among different character sets and among single-byte and multi-byte character representations. When the name field is repeated, the different repetitions of the name may be represented by these different character sets. The details are as follows. (See also Section 2.9.2, “Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets for PN, XPN, XCN, XON, XAD, FT, ST and TX data types.”)

HL7 supports the following standards for Japanese characters:

JIS X 0201 for ISO-IR 13 (Japanese Katakana)

JIS X 0201 for ISO-IR 14 (Japanese Romaji)

JIS X 0208 for ISO-IR 87 (Japanese Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana)

JIS X 0212 for ISO-IR 159 (supplementary Japanese Kanji)

HL7 supports the following standards for European characters:

ISO 8859 (1-9) for ISO-IR 100, 101, 109, 110, 144,127, 126, 138 and 148.

Character sets are referenced in HL7 as ASCII, 8859/1,8859/2, ISO IR14, ISO IR87, and ISO IR159. DICOM uses codes laid out in ISO 2375, of the form 'ISO-IR xxx'. HL7 supports this naming as well, to facilitate interoperability.

HL7 uses the Basic G0 Set of the International Reference Version of ISO 646:1990 (ISO IR-6) as the default character repertoire for character strings. This is a single-byte character set, identical to ASCII.

Each repetition of a XPN, XON, XCN, or XAD field is assumed to begin with the default character set. If another character set is to be used, the HL7 defined escape sequence used to announce that character set must be at the beginning of the repetition, and the HL7 defined escape sequence used to start the default character set must be at the end of the repetition. Note also that several character sets may be intermixed within a single repetition as long as the repetition ends with a return to the default character set.

An application must specify which character sets it supports in the field _MSH-18 Character Sets_ and which character set handling scheme it supports in the field _MSH-20 Alternate Character Set Handling Scheme_. It is assumed that the sending and receiving applications are aware of how to map character set names (i.e., ISO-IR xxx) to escape sequences.

For example, in many Japanese messages there is a mix of Romaji (i.e., Roman characters), Katakana (phonetic representation of foreign words), Hiragana (phonetic representation of Japanese words) and Kanji (pictographs). Such a message would require 4 character sets be specified in the MSH.

The Professional Suffix normally follows the Family Name when the Person Name is used for display purposes. Please note that this component is an unformatted string and is used for display purposes only. Detailed information regarding the contents of Professional Suffix is obtained using appropriate segments in Chapter 15, Personnel Management.

==== 2A.2.90.15 Called By (ST)

Definition: A "called by" name is the name that is preferred when a person is directly addressed; sometimes known as a nickname.

*Note:* The called by component contains a name that could be categorized as a nickname using the name usage types in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70200[_HL7 Table 0200 - Name type_]. Its use is reserved for instances in which the nickname is a single name part that is provided in addition to a name that has some other type, such as legal. It is understood that the "called by" name is not part of the full name. Where a nickname has more parts, possibly including a family name, a different XPN with a type of nickname should instead be used.

Examples:

____
• James Robert Smith is Called By Jim Bob

• James Robert Smith is Called By JR

• Peter Richard Smith is Called By Richard

Example 1: A Work fax number

^WPN^FX^^^734^6777777

Example 2: Telephone number with extension

^WPN^PH^^^734^6777777^1

Example 2: Telephone number with internal code. In this example, assume that a corporation's telephone system supports a full external telephone number (area code and telephone number). It also supports internal dialing standards that assign a code to each facility and an extension to each telephone (which happens to be the last 4 digits of the external telephone number, by convention).

So, if the Los Angeles facility were assigned code 333, and if the "outside" telephone number at the LA office is (626) 555-1234, the components would be:

[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|===
|Component |Value
|area/city code |626
|phone number |555-1234
|extension |1234
|extension prefix |333
|===

The field would be transmitted as follows:

^WPN^PH^^^626^5551234^1234^333

Example 3: speed dial. In this example, assume that a corporation's telephone system supports speed dialing numbers. For example, suppose that a corporation has a contract with a travel agency, whose external number is 1-610-555-1234. Since it is so frequently dialed, the company assigns a speed code: #6098. The components would be:

[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|===
|Component |Value
|Area/city code |610
|Phone number |555-1234
|Speed Dial |#6098
|===

The field would be transmitted as follows:

^WPN^PH^^^610^5551234^^^#6098

Example 4: home e-mail address. In this example, assume that a person has a primary home e-mail address such as someone@somewhere.com. The components would be:

[width="100%",cols="56%,44%",options="header",]
|===
|Component |Value
|Telecommunication Use Code |PRN
|Telecommunication Equipment Type |Internet
|Communication Address |someone@somewhere.com
|===

The field would be transmitted as follows:

^PRN^Internet^someone@somewhere.com

Example 5: work e-mail address. In this example, assume that a person has a work e-mail address such as someone@somewhere.com. The components would be:

[width="100%",cols="54%,46%",options="header",]
|===
|Component |Value
|Telecommunication Use Code |WPN
|Telecommunication Equipment Type |Internet
|Communication Address |someone@somewhere.com
|===

The field would be transmitted as follows:

^WPN^Internet^someone@somewhere.com

==== 2A.2.91.0 

==== 2A.2.91.1 Telephone Number 

*Attention:* _The XTN-1 component was deprecated as of v2.3 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v2.6._

==== 2A.2.91.2 Telecommunication Use Code (ID) 

Definition: A code that represents a specific use of a telecommunication number. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70201[_HL7 Table 0201 - Telecommunication Use Code_] for valid values. This component along with _XTN.3_ describes the nature of the telecommunication data that follows. Best practice requires the population of _XTN.2_ when _XTN.4_ or _XTN.7_ is populated.

==== 2A.2.91.3 Telecommunication Equipment Type (ID)

Definition: A code that represents the type of telecommunication equipment. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70202[_HL7 Tabl__e 0202 - Telecommunication Equipment Type_] for valid values. This component along with _XTN.2_ describes the nature of the telecommunication data that follows and is necessary to accurately interpret it.

==== 2A.2.91.4 Communication Address (ST)

*Note*: This component is required if, and only allowed if, XTN.7 or XTN.12 are not populated.

*Note*: If any of the HL7 delimiters are found in the Communication Address, such as @, the appropriate HL7 escape sequence SHALL be used when encoding an Internet address (see Chapter 2, "Control", section 2.7.1, "Formatting Codes").

==== 2A.2.91.5 Country Code (SNM)

Definition: The numeric code assigned by the http://www.wordiq.com/definition/International_Telecommunication_Union[International Telecommunication Union] in standard http://www.wordiq.com/definition/E.164[E.164] to access telephone services in another country. For example, "+1" is the country code for the United States, "+49" is the code for Germany.

==== 2A.2.91.6 Area/City Code (SNM)

Definition: The numeric code to access telephone services in another area/city within a country. This number historically needs not be dialed if the caller is located in the same area/city as the phone number of the called party.

The use and size of area/city codes is however country specific: some countries do not use area/city codes, or the use of area/city codes may be mandatory when dialing, or area/city codes may be used to group phone numbers based on other criteria than geographic location, such as cell-phone area/city-codes, or free information numbers (e.g., 800 numbers).

Most countries have a prefix for Area/City codes which only has to be dialed if one doesn't use a country code. This prefix (mostly "0", sometimes "9") should be omitted from the content of this field. If the prefix for the Area/Code is also mandatory if one uses the country code (e.g., in Italy) then this field should also contain the prefix.

==== 2A.2.91.7 Local Number (SNM)

Definition: The numeric code used to contact the called party, exclusive of country and area/city codes. The Local Number is required when, and allowed only if, _XTN.4_ and _XTN.12_ are not populated.

The size of the Local Number is country specific.

*Note*: The Local Number does not include the numeric codes that have to be dialed once a connection has been established. Examples include (automated) organizational phone systems which allow external callers to dial additional numeric codes. These additional numeric codes should be specified as an extension.

==== 2A.2.91.8 Extension (SNM)

Definition: The numeric code to contact the called party used within an organization, e.g., the number used if both caller and called party are located within the same organization. The extension is often the same as the last few digits of the Local Number. The use of extensions is country and site specific, and may depend on the type of phone system (PBX) used by the organization.

==== 2A.2.91.9 Any Text (ST)

Definition: Contains comments with respect to the telephone number.

Example: |^^^^^^^^Do not use after 5PM|

==== 2A.2.91.10 Extension Prefix (ST)

Definition: The characters established within a company’s internal telephone system network used as a prefix to the Extension component for internal dialing.

*Note:* The use of Extension Prefix requires that the Extension component be valued and that digits, as well as special characters (e.g., *, #) may be used.

==== 2A.2.91.11 Speed Dial Code (ST)

Definition: The characters established within a company’s internal telephone system used in place of the (external) telephone number to facilitate calling because its length is shorter than that of the telephone number.

*Note:* Digits, as well as special characters (e.g., *, #) may be used.

==== 2A.2.91.12 Unformatted Telephone Number (ST)

Definition: An expression of the telephone number as an unparsable string. The Unformatted Telephone number is required when, and allowed only if, _XTN.4_ and _XTN.7_ are not populated.

The phone number was entered as free text and sending system does not know how to parse it.

Example: |^^^^^^^^^^^1-800-Dentist|

==== 2A.2.91.13 Effective Start Date (DTM)

Definition: The first date, if known, on which the telecommunication number is valid and active.

==== 2A.2.91.14 Expiration Date (DTM)

Definition: The last date, if known, on which the telecommunication number is valid and active.

==== 2A.2.91.15 Expiration Reason (CWE)

Definition: Indicates why this contact number/e-mail was marked as "ended". Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70868[User-defined Table 0868 – Telecommunication Expiration Reason] for valid values.

==== 2A.2.91.16 Protection Code (CWE)

Definition: Indicates whether this information is considered sensitive or should be protected in some way. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70618[_User-defined table 0618 - Protection Code_] for suggested values.

The specific set of codes and appropriate handling of such telecommunications addresses will vary by jurisdiction and is subject to site-specific negotiation. For example, a provider address marked as 'unlisted' might not be printed in an internal address listing.

==== 2A.2.91.17 Shared Telecommunication Identifier (EI)

Definition: A unique identifier for the phone number or e-mail address.

This component allows a phone number to be uniquely identified, and enables the linking of a single phone number to multiple people and contexts. For example, each member of a family living at the same location would share the same phone number, having the same identifier. A correction to the phone number of one family member could be automatically propagated to other members of the family.

HL7 does not assume responsibility for the processing rules for this component.

==== 2A.2.91.18 Preference Order (NM)

Definition: For an entity having multiple telecommunication addresses, indicates which is the "most preferred" (lowest number) to "least preferred" (highest number).

If the preference order is unique across all usages for a given type, then it indicates the preference across all usages, (e.g. first try my home number, then my business number). If the preference order is unique across all usages and types, then it indicates the preference across all types of telecommunication addresses. (E.g., first try my phone; if that doesn't work, use my pager.) Otherwise, the preference order is assumed to only apply within a specific type and usage.

Preference order numbers need not be sequential (i.e., three numbers with the priority orders of 0, 5 and 15 are legitimate). The preference order numbers must be non-negative.
