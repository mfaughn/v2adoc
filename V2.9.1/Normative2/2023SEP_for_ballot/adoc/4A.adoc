== 4A.2 Purpose

This extension of chapter 4 was created because as of version 2.6 it had become too large to edit without great difficulty. Thus, the sections specific to pharmacy and vaccines were excised from that chapter and now comprise the content of this chapter.

=== 4A.2.1 Preface (organization of this chapter)

This chapter is organized into two major sections, Pharmacy, and Vaccine. Each section contains the trigger events, message definitions, segments and examples for the specific type of order messages. Each section about a type of order is organized into background and overview, message structure, and message segments (that are specific to the order class in question). Special discussions of the use of fields, segments or messages, and examples are included. Segments are introduced in order of occurrence in a message. A list of allowable values for a field is included in the body of the text, along with the field definition for easier reference.

*Section 4A.3 to 4A.6* Covers pharmacy/treatment trigger events & messages, pharmacy/treatment segments, pharmacy/treatment message examples and pharmacy/treatment message flow diagrams.

*Sections 4A.7 to 4A.6* Covers vaccine trigger events & message definitions, vaccine segments and vaccine message examples.

== 4A.3 Pharmacy/Treatment Trigger Events & Messages

=== 4A.3.1 Usage notes for pharmacy/treatment messages

For the RDS (pharmacy/treatment dispense), RGV (pharmacy/treatment give) and RAS (pharmacy/treatment administration) messages, the placer and filler order numbers are those of the parent RDE (pharmacy/treatment encoded order) message. In these messages, the filler order number does not provide a unique identification of the instance of the pharmacy/treatment action (dispense, give or administer). To correct this problem, each of the defining segments (RXD, RXG, and RXA) has an appropriately named sub-ID field (dispense sub-ID counter, give sub-ID counter, and administration sub-ID counter). The combination of the filler order number (including its application ID component) and the appropriate sub-ID counter uniquely identifies the instance of the pharmacy/treatment action(s) present in these messages.

Although the default order control code for the RDE, RDS, RGV and RAS messages is "RE," there are cases in which the pharmacy or treatment system and the receiving system must communicate changes in state. Depending on whether the pharmacy or treatment supplier's relationship to the receiving system is that of placer or filler, the appropriate order control code may be substituted for the default value of RE. The receiving system can also use an appropriate order control code to report status back to the pharmacy or treatment system.

For example, suppose that a pharmacy or treatment system is sending RGV messages to a nursing system which will administer the medication and that the pharmacy or treatment system needs to request that several instances of a give order be discontinued. To implement this request, the RGV message may be sent with a "DC" order control code (discontinue request), and the appropriate RXG segments whose give sub-ID fields identify the instances to be discontinued. If a notification back to the pharmacy or treatment supplier is needed, the nursing system can initiate an RGV message with a "DR" order control code (discontinue as requested), and containing RXG segments whose give sub-ID fields identify the discontinued instances.

=== 4A.3.2 IV solution groups

An order for a group of IV solutions to be given sequentially can be supported in two similar ways: Parent/Child and Separate Orders. This HL7 Standard supports both methods of ordering. The method used at a particular site must be negotiated between the site institution and the various application vendors. See Chapter 2, section 2.A.53 OSD Order Sequence Definition, "Use Case 1 Cyclic placer order groups," for further details.

=== 4A.3.5 RDE/RRE - pharmacy/treatment encoded order message (O01/O02)

*_Attention: The use of RDE with the trigger of O01 and RRE with the trigger O02 is maintained for backward compatibility as of v 2.4 and is withdrawn as of v 2.7._ _Refer to RDE with trigger O11 and RRE with trigger O12 instead._*

=== 4A.3.6 RDE - Pharmacy/Treatment Encoded Order Message (Event O11)

This message communicates the pharmacy or treatment application's encoding of the pharmacy/treatment order ,OMP, message. It may be sent as an unsolicited message to report on either a single order or multiple pharmacy/treatment orders for a patient.

The RDE/RRE message pair can also be used to communicate a refill authorization request; however, a specific trigger event has been assigned. See section _4A.3.16 "RDE - Pharmacy/Treatment Refill Authorization Request Message_ (Event O25)_."_ As a site-specific variant, the original order segments (RXO, RXRs, associated RXCs, and any NTEs) may be sent optionally (for comparison).

The event O11 represents an encoding of an order. To communicate explicit dispense requests, which are different event types, the RDE^O11/RRE^O12 message pair is also used, but the event O49 is preferred. See section 4A.3.23 "RDE - Pharmacy/Treatment Refill Authorization Request Message (Event O25)." As a site-specific variant, the original order segments (RXO, RXRs, associated RXCs, and any NTEs) may be sent optionally (for comparison).

=== 4A.3.8 RDS - Pharmacy/Treatment Dispense Message (Event O13)

The RDS message may be created by the pharmacy/treatment application for each instance of dispensing a drug or treatment to fill an existing order or orders. In the most common case, the RDS messages would be routed to a Nursing application or to some clinical application, which needs the data about drugs dispensed or treatments given. As a site-specific variant, the original order segments (RXO, RXE and their associated RXR/RXCs) may be sent optionally (for comparison).

The ORC must have the filler order number and the order control code RE. The RXE and associated RXCs may be present if the receiving application needs any of their data. The RXD carries the dispense data for a given issuance of medication: thus it may describe a single dose, a half-day dose, a daily dose, a refill of a prescription, etc. The RXD is not a complete record of an order. Use the RXO and RXE segments if a complete order is needed. It is a record from the pharmacy or treatment supplier to the Nursing application (or other) with drug/treatment dispense and administration instructions.

The FT1 segment is optional and repeating in order to accommodate multiple charge, benefit and pricing situations. Example use cases demonstrating zero, one and two FT1 segments follow:

In the case where the RDS message represents a dispense event that is in process (i.e., has not been received by the patient), the financial transactions associated with the dispense do not yet exist. Until the financial transactions associated with the dispense event have been completed, no FT1 segment may exist in the message.

In the case where the RDS message represents a dispense event that has been received by the patient, and thus all financial transactions have been completed, the RDS message may contain one or more FT1 segments. Examples of single and multiple FT1 segments follow.

Payment for the dispense event completed by a single payor:

=== 4A.3.11 RGV - Pharmacy/Treatment Give Message (Event O15) 

When the "give" (i.e., administration) information needs to be transmitted from the pharmacy or treatment application to another application, it is done with the RGV message. The RGV message uses the RXG segment to record drug or treatment administration instructions, which is not contained in an RDS, dispense message. The RGV message may carry information about a single scheduled administration on a drug or treatment, or it may carry information about multiple administrations. If the pharmacy or treatment application (or some other application) needs to create an unambiguous MAR report where each administration is matched to a particular give date/time instruction, it may use the RGV message as described in the following way:

For each scheduled administration of the medication, the pharmacy/treatment issues either a single RGV message or a single RGV message with multiple RXG segments, one for each scheduled administration. The actual administrations (transmitted by one or more RAS messages) are matched against the scheduled ones by recording in each RXA segment the Give Sub-ID of the corresponding RXG segment. If more than one administration needs to be matched (as in the case of recording a change or rate of an IV solution) the administering application issues additional RXA segment(s) (corresponding to the same RXG segment). If no matching is needed, the Give Sub-ID of the RXA segments has the value zero (0).

When used for a scheduled administration or for the start of a continuous administration such as an IV fluid, the ORC must have the filler order number and the order control code RE.

When used for an update to a continuous administration which is currently in progress (e.g. change of rate of an IV fluid), the ORC must have the filler order number and the order control code XO. For these updates the value of RXG-1 Give Sub-ID Counter may be used to provide a unique reference (see section 4A.4.6.1).

The RXE and associated RXCs may be present if the receiving application needs any of their data. The RXG carries the scheduled administration data for either a single "give instruction" (single dose) of medication or for multiple "give instructions." The RXG is not a complete record of an order. Use the RXO and RXE segments if a complete order is needed. It is a record from the pharmacy or treatment application to the Nursing application (or other) with drug/treatment administration instructions.

*Note: _The use of RAS with the trigger of O01 and RRA with the trigger O02 is maintained for backward compatibility as of v2.4 and is withdrawn as of v2.7. Refer to RAS with trigger O17 and RRA with trigger O18 instead._*

=== 4A.3.14 RAS - Pharmacy/Treatment Administration Message (Event O17) 

The RAS message may be created by the administering application (e.g., nursing application) for each instance of administration for an existing order. If the administering application wants to report several administrations of medication/treatment for a given order with a single RAS message, each instance is reported by a separate (repeating) RXA segment. In addition, the administration records for a group of orders may be sent in a single message by creating repeating groups of segments at the ORC level.

In the most common case, the RAS messages would be sent from a nursing application to the pharmacy or treatment application (or to the ordering application or another clinical application), which could use the data to generate the medication administration reports. Multiple RXA segments, each corresponding to a separate administration instance for a given order, may be sent with a single ORC.

=== 4A.3.24 RDE - Pharmacy/Treatment Dispense Request Message (Event O49)

This message communicates the request to dispense items. It may be sent as a consequence of an existing order. It may not follow the order immediately: The pharmacist receives clinical orders continuously, but may decide that the orders for dispense are sent periodically. This illustrates that there is a new event.

This message is also not required to contain the order in its entirety: for example if one RDE^O11 contains 3 medications order there are 3 dispensing locations, the pharmacist issues one RDE^O49 for each medication. Any supply aspects are handled through these new types of message, while the clinical order can be segregated from such supply constraints.

The order to dispense refers to the “clinical” order, the original RDE^O25 (or OMP^O09) by means of a parent-child hierarchy, where ORC-8 of the OXX message refers to the ORC-2 of the RDE^025 order.

=== 4A.3.26 RCV - Pharmacy/Treatment Dispense Message (Event O59)

The RCV message may be created to communicate the reception of items. This message supports reception of items to fill an existing order or orders, or to stock refills. In the most common case, the RCV messages would be routed to the dispensing system that issued the RDS message. The RDS message informs of the items that have been sent, while the RCV informs about the effectively received items (thus supporting any change in quantities, status,e tc., derived from transport or from a mismatch between the actually sent items and the content of the RDS).

In typical cases, the RCV^O59 message is an “echo” of one RDS^O13, but this is not forcibly so: Since the shipment and reception are asynchronous events, and considering variants in delivery, it is expected that one RCV^OYY message is issued for each confirmation of a reception, independently of whether there was one shipment or several shipments.

The RXD segment carries the dispense data for a given reception of the received items.

The FT1 segment is optional and repeating in order to accommodate multiple charge, benefit and pricing situations. When a message of type RCV is used, the FT1 may be included in the RCV message. If the RCV^O59 message is not used by the implementation, then the RDS may contain the FT1 segment.

== 4A.4 Pharmacy/Treatment Segments

=== 4A.4.1 RXO - Pharmacy/Treatment Order Segment

This is the "master" pharmacy/treatment order segment. It contains order data not specific to components or additives. Unlike the OBR, it does not contain status fields or other data that are results-only.

It can be used for any type of pharmacy order, including inpatient (unit dose and compound unit dose), outpatient, IVs, and hyperalimentation IVs (nutritional IVs), as well as other non-pharmacy treatments, e.g., respiratory therapy, oxygen, and many nursing treatments.

In addition to the pharmaceutical/treatment information, this segment contains additional data such as provider and text comments.

A quantity/timing field is not needed in the RXO segment. The ORC segment contains the requested _ORC-7-quantity/timing_ of the original order which does not change as the order is encoded, dispensed, or administered.

==== 4A.4.1.0 RXO field definitions

==== 4A.4.1.1 RXO-1 Requested Give Code (CWE) 00292

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field identifies the treatment product or treatment ordered to be given to the patient; it is analogous to _OBR-4-universal service ID_ in function. Examples of treatments products include medications and certain devices or supplies, e.g., inhaler spacers, blood glucose monitors, syringes, infusion sets, which might require prescription. Refer to Table 0747 - Requested Give Code in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Often the coded entry implies dosage form and a dosage form is required in addition to the product name. When the give code does not include the dosage form, use _RXO-5-requested dosage form_. When the give code does not include the strength, use _RXO-18-requested give strength_ and the _RXO-19-requested give units. Realize that strengths do not apply to some such orders._

The RXO-1, RXO-2 and RXO-4 are mandatory unless the prescription/treatment is transmitted as free text using RXO-6; then RXO-1, RXO-2, and RXO-4 may be blank and the first subcomponent of RXO-6 must be blank.

Use of the RXO-6.2 versus the RXO-1.2 for a free text order is dependent on whether or not the free text describes a product or if it is more commentary in nature.

Please refer to the request –to-dispense fields RXO-10, RXO-11, and RXO-12 for a discussion of the interrelationship with the request-to-give fields.

==== 4A.4.1.2 RXO-2 Requested Give Amount - Minimum (NM) 00293

Definition: This field is the ordered amount. In a variable dose order, this is the minimum ordered amount. In a non-varying dose order, this is the exact amount of the order.

The RXO-1, RXO-2 and RXO-4 are mandatory unless the prescription/treatment is transmitted as free text using RXO-6, then RXO-1, RXO-2, and RXO-4 may be blank and the first subcomponent of RXO-6 must be blank.

*Note:* This field is not a duplication of the first component of the quantity/timing field, since in non-pharmacy/treatment orders, that component can be used to specify multiples of an ordered amount. +
 +
Another way to say this is that, for pharmacy/treatment orders, the quantity component of the quantity/timing field refers to what is to be given out at each service interval; thus, in terms of the RX order, that first component always defaults to 1. Hence, in the actual execution of the order, the value of 1 in the first component of the quantity/timing field always refers to one administration of the amount specified in this field (the Requested Give Amount field).

==== 4A.4.1.3 RXO-3 Requested Give Amount - Maximum (NM) 00294

Definition: In a variable dose order, this is the maximum ordered amount. In a non-varying dose order, this field is not used.

==== 4A.4.1.4 RXO-4 Requested Give Units (CWE) 00295

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field indicates the units for the give amount. Refer to Table 0748 - Requested Give Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

The RXO-1, RXO-2 and RXO-4 are mandatory unless the prescription is transmitted as free text using RXO-6, then RXO-1, RXO-2, and RXO-4 may be blank and the first subcomponent of RXO-6 must be blank.

*Note:* These units can be a "compound quantity"; i.e., the units may contain the word "per." For example, micrograms per KG (micg/kg) is an acceptable value, which means that the units are micrograms per KG (of body weight). See Chapter 7 for full definition of ISO+ units.

A table of standard units is needed to define standard abbreviations for compound units. Until such a table is agreed on, a user-defined table is needed for each site. If the interpretation of a compound unit requires knowledge of some observation results (such as body weight or height), these results can be sent in the same order message using the optional OBX segments.

==== 4A.4.1.5 RXO-5 Requested Dosage Form (CWE) 00296

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field indicates the manner in which the treatment is aggregated for dispensing, e.g., tablets, capsules suppositories. In some cases, this information is implied by the dispense/give code in _RXO-1-requested give code_ or _RXO-10-Requested dispense code_. Required when both _RXO-1-Requested give code_ and _RXO-10-Requested dispense code_ do not specify the drug/treatment form; optionally included otherwise. Refer to Table 0750 - Requested Dosage Form in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 4A.4.1.6 RXO-6 Provider's Pharmacy/Treatment Instructions (CWE) 00297

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field identifies the ordering provider's instructions to the pharmacy or the non-pharmacy treatment provider (e.g., respiratory therapy). If coded, a user-defined table must be used. If transmitted as a free text field, place a null in the first component and the text in the second, e.g., |^this is a free text treatment instruction|.Refer to Table 0751 - Provider's Pharmacy/Treatment Instructions in Chapter 2C for valid values.

If the prescription is transmitted as free text using RXO-6, then RXO-1, RXO-2, and RXO-4 may be blank and the first subcomponent of RXO-6 must be blank. Otherwise, RXO-1, RXO-2 and RXO-4 are mandatory.

==== 4A.4.1.7 RXO-7 Provider's Administration Instructions (CWE) 00298

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field identifies the ordering provider's instructions to the patient or to the provider administering the drug or treatment. If coded, a user-defined table must be used. If transmitted as free text, place a null in the first component and the text in the second, e.g., |^this is a free text administration instruction|.Refer to Table 0752 - Provider's Administration Instructions in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 4A.4.1.8 RXO-8 Deliver-to Location

Attention: The RXO-8 field was retained for backward compatibilty only as of v 2.6 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.8.

==== 4A.4.1.9 RXO-9 Allow Substitutions (ID) 00300

Definition: Coded values indicate whether substitutions are allowed, and, if yes, what type of substitutions. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70161[_HL7 Table 0161 – Allow Substitution_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid codes.

==== 4A.4.1.10 RXO-10 Requested Dispense Code (CWE) 00301

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field indicates what is to be/was dispensed; it is analogous to _OBR-4-universal service ID_ in function. It may be present in the order or not, depending on the application. If not present, and values are given for _RXO-11-requested dispense amount_ and _RXO-12-requested dispense units_, the _RXO-1-requested give code_ is assumed. If the requested dispense code does not include the dosage form, then _RXO-5-requested dosage form_ is required. Refer to Table 0753 - Requested Dispense Code in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Note on request-to-dispense fields:

Sometimes an order will be written in which the total amount of the drug or treatment requested to be dispensed has no direct relationship with the give amounts and schedule. For example, an outpatient pharmacy/treatment order might be _take four tablets a day of <drug name, value>, Q6H (every 6 hours) -- dispense 30 tablets_. An inpatient order might be _NS/D5W (normal saline with 5% dextrose) at 1000cc/hour—dispense 3 1-liter bottles of NSD5W solution_. The request-to-dispense fields support this common style of ordering.

==== 4A.4.1.11 RXO-11 Requested Dispense Amount (NM) 00302

Definition: This field specifies the amount to be dispensed. See above note.

==== 4A.4.1.12 RXO-12 Requested Dispense Units (CWE) 00303

Definition: This field identifies the units for the dispense amount. This must be in simple units that reflect the actual quantity of the substance to be dispensed. It does not include compound units. See above note. Refer to Table 0754 - Requested Dispense Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 4A.4.1.13 RXO-13 Number of Refills (NM) 00304

Definition: This field defines the number of times the requested dispense amount can be given to the patient, subject to local regulation. Refers to outpatient only.

==== 4A.4.1.14 RXO-14 Ordering Provider's DEA Number

Attention: This field was retained for backward compatibilty only as of v 2.7 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment described in Chapter 7.

Definition: This field is the provider ID of the pharmacist/treatment supplier verifier. Use if required by the pharmacy or treatment application or site on orders (or some subgroup of orders), in addition to _ORC-11-verified by_.

Example:

The site requires a "verified by" provider (such as a nurse) and a "verifying pharmacist/treatment supplier" on the order. In this case the first field, _ORC-11-verified by_, is already present; but the second field, _RXO-15-pharmacist/treatment supplier's verifier ID_, is needed.

==== 4A.4.1.16 RXO-16 Needs Human Review (ID) 00307

Definition: This field uses file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70136[_HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/No Indicator_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables. The values have the following meaning for this field:

Y Yes - Indicates that the pharmacist or non-pharmacist treatment supplier filling the order needs to pay special attention to the text in the _RXO-6-provider's pharmacy/treatment instructions_. A warning is present.

N No - No warning is present. This is the equivalent default (null) value.

An example of the use of this field is given by the following case:

A _smart_ Order Entry application knows of a possible drug or treatment interaction on a certain order, but the provider issuing the order wants to override the condition. In this case, the pharmacy or treatment application receiving the order will want to have a staff pharmacist or non-pharmacist treatment supplier review the interaction and contact the ordering physician.

==== 4A.4.1.17 RXO-17 Requested Give Per (Time Unit) (ST) 00308

Definition: This field identifies the time unit to use to calculate the rate at which the pharmaceutical is to be administered.

Format:

[width="100%",cols="32%,11%,57%",]
|===
|S<integer> |= |<integer> seconds
|M<integer> |= |<integer> minutes
|H<integer> |= |<integer> hours
|D<integer> |= |<integer> days
|W<integer> |= |<integer> weeks
|L<integer> |= |<integer> months
|===

*Note:* This is the same as the format specified for the DURATION component of the quantity/timing field, excluding the "X" specification.

This field is defined as conditional because it is required when the ordered substance is to be administered continuously at a prescribed rate (e.g., certain IVs). For example, if the "give amount/units" are 300 ml and the "give per" time unit is H1, the rate is 300ml/hr and the duration of this dose is 1 hour. Thus the give amount and give per time unit define the duration of the service.

This field is distinct from the "interval" component of the quantity/timing field, but it could be used in conjunction with it, as in _give 300ml of NS per hr for 1 hour, repeat twice a day_.

==== 4A.4.1.18 RXO-18 Requested Give Strength (NM) 01121

Definition: Required when RXO-1-requested give code does not specify the strength; optionally included otherwise. This is the numeric part of the strength, used in combination with _RXO-19-requested give strength units_.

The need for strength and strength unit fields in addition to the amount and amount units fields included in various RX_ segments requires explanation. Physicians can write a prescription for a drug such as Ampicillin in two ways. One way would be: "Ampicillin 250 mg capsules, 2 capsules four times a day." In this case the give amount would be 2, the give units would be capsules, the strength would be 250 and the strength units would milligrams.

However, the provider could also write the pharmaceutical treatment as "Ampicillin 500 mg four times a day." In this case the give amount would be 500 and the give units would be milligrams. The strength would not be reported in the RXO segment because it is not specified; the drug could be given in two 250 mg caps or one 500 mg cap. But the pharmacist would dispense a specific capsule size and would record the strength in the RXE segment as 250 or 500, depending upon which capsule size was dispensed.

Some coding systems imply the strength, units, route of administration, and manufacturer of substances within a single instructional code. NDC codes, for example, usually imply not only the medical substance, but also the strength, the units, and the form, e.g., 0047-0402-30^Ampicillin 250 MG CAPS^NDC. So all of this information can also be completely specified in _RXO-1-requested give code_ and in the analogous CWE/CNE fields in other pharmacy/treatment segments. In this case, it is not necessary to use the strength and strength units fields to specify this information.

==== 4A.4.1.19 RXO-19 Requested Give Strength Units (CWE) 01122

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: Required when both _RXO-1-requested give code_ and _RXO-10-requested dispense code_ do not specify the strength; optionally included otherwise. This is the unit of the strength, used in combination with _RXO-18-requested give strength_. Refer to Table 0756 - Requested Give Strength Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

*Note:* These units can be a "compound quantity;" i.e., the units may express a quantity per unit of time. For example, micrograms per hour (micg/h) is an acceptable value. These compound units are contained in the ISO+ table. See Chapter 7 for full definition of ISO+ units.

==== 4A.4.1.25 RXO-25 Requested Drug Strength Volume (NM) 01666

Description: This numeric field defines the volume measurement in which the drug strength concentration is contained. For example, Acetaminophen 120 MG/5ML Elixir means that 120 MG of the drug is in a solution with a volume of 5 ML, which would be encoded in RXO-18, RXO-19, RXO-25 and RXO-26 as:

RXO||||||||||||||||||120|mg^^ISO||||||5|ml^^ISO ...<cr>

==== 4A.4.1.26 RXO-26 Requested Drug Strength Volume Units (CWE) 01667

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Description: This field indicates the volumetric unit associated with _RXO-25 Requested Drug Strength Volume_. See example in RXO-25. Refer to Table 0764 - Requested Drug Strength Volume Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 4A.4.1.27 RXO-27 Pharmacy Order Type (ID) 01668

Definition: The Pharmacy Order Type field defines the general category of pharmacy order which may be used to determine the processing path the order will take. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70480[_HL7 Table 0480 — Pharmacy Order Types_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

This field may also be used for grouping of related orders for processing and/or reports. For example, Medication Administration Records (MARs) often group large volume solutions, medications and small volume solutions differently based upon site-specific workflow.

Usage Rule: This field is optional for all Pharmacy transactions. When not populated, a default value of "M" is assumed.

==== 4A.4.1.28 RXO-28 Dispensing Interval (NM) 01669

Definition: This field specifies the minimum number of days that must occur between dispensing events

==== 4A.4.1.29 RXO-29 Medication Instance Identifier (EI) 02149

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains a value that uniquely identifies the medication associated with this segment. Rather than identifying the product to be given, as in _RXO-1 Requested Give Code_, this field serves to identify the medication in association with the order represented by the segment instance. This identifier is persistent within and across message instances.

Note: RXO-29 Medication Instance Identifier was introduced in v2.6 to support Patient Care messaging concepts and constructs. At this time, there are no documented use cases for this field in the context of a pharmacy/treatment orders as described in this chapter. This statement does not preclude the use of RXO-29 in pharmacy messages, but implementers should exercise caution in using this field outside of the Patient Care context until the pharmacy/treatment use cases are established.

==== 4A.4.1.30 RXO-30 Segment Instance Identifier (EI) 02150

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains a value that uniquely identifies this segment across time and messages. This is not intended as a "Set ID", but as a unique identifier allowing references not only to segments of the same message, but also to segments of other messages and indirectly to the entities described in those segments if the necessary persistence was manageable by the applications. This identifier is persistent within and across message instances.

Note: RXO-30 Segment Instance Identifier was introduced in v 2.6 to support Patient Care messaging concepts and constructs. At this time, there are no documented use cases for this field in the context of a pharmacy/treatment orders as described in this chapter. This statement does not preclude the use of RXO-30 in pharmacy messages, but implementers should exercise caution in using this field outside of the Patient Care context until the pharmacy/treatment use cases are established.

Definition: This field represents the functional state of the order represented by this segment instance. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70725[_HL7 Table 0725 – Mood Codes_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values. This field may only be used with new trigger events and new messages from v2.6 onward. When this field is not valued in a message that qualifies, then the value is assumed to be 'EVN'.

There may appear to be overlap between this field and _ORC-5 Order Status_. However, the intent of Mood Code is to support the description and documentation of historical events. In this context, Mood codes may clash with Order Status codes, a Mood code may apply for different Order Status values, or this segment may be being used outside of the order paradigm (e.g., in a patient care plan). Moods are meant to change the semantics of clinical data in a message when it is not inferable from the trigger event: when the data can represent a past medication, a future medication (e.g., in a patient care plan), or in a request (e.g., as a reason for referral). The reader is referred to Chapter 12, Patient Care, for further discussion of patient care plans and referrals.

Note: RXO-31 Mood Code was introduced in v2.6 to support Patient Care messaging concepts and constructs. At this time, there are no documented use cases for this field in the context of a pharmacy/treatment orders as described in this chapter. This statement does not preclude the use of RXO-31 in pharmacy messages, but implementers should exercise caution in using this field outside of the Patient Care context until the pharmacy/treatment use cases are established. While a similar note exists for RXO-29 Medication Instance Identifier and RXO-30 Segment Instance Identifier, particular care should be taken with RXO-31 as this could modify the intent of the segment/message and create backward compatibility problems.

==== 4A.4.3.0 RXC field definitions

==== 4A.4.3.1 RXC-1 RX Component Type (ID) 00313

Definition: Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70166[_HL7 Table 0166 – RX Component Type_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables for valide values.

For the non-IV case, the "B" value may still apply. For example, if a custom dermatologic salve is being prepared, the "B" item might be a standard base ointment into which other components are mixed.

The amount of the "base" specified in the "B" segment(s) is defined to be the quantity into which amounts specified in the "A" components are mixed. Thus the RXC segments as a group define the "recipe" for a particular amount (defined by the base segment(s)). The give amount, as defined in the RXO, does not need to correspond to this base amount. For example, the RXC segments may specify a recipe for a liter of a standard type of saline with 1 gram of a particular antimicrobial, while the give amount (from the RXO) may specify the administration of 2 liters of this IV-solution every 24 hours.

The amount specified in each "A" segment is defined to be the quantity to be added to the amount of the base as specified in its RXC segment.

If any "base" components are present then these should be transmitted first. The first "base" component in the transmission should be considered the "primary base" if such a distinction is necessary. Similarly, the first "additive" in the transmission should be considered the "primary additive" if such a distinction is necessary.

==== 4A.4.3.2 RXC-2 Component Code (CWE) 00314

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field is equivalent to _OBR-4-universal service ID_. It defines the base or component in the same manner as the give and dispense codes. As with the give and dispense codes, it may contain text only, code only, text + code, or text + code + units (implied or explicit). As with the give and dispense codes, if _RXC-4-component units_ is present, this overrides the units implied by the code. If only text is present, the pharmacy or treatment application must include a manual review or reentering of the component drug or treatment. Refer to Table 0697 - Component Code in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 4A.4.3.3 RXC-3 Component Amount (NM) 00315

Definition: This field identifies the amount of this component to be added to the specified amount of the base.

Common codes include: the Generic Product Identifier (GPI), Generic Code Number_Sequence Number (GCN_SEQNO), National Drug Code (NDC)_._ _Refer to Table 0700 - Supplementary Code in Chapter 2C for valid values._

==== 4A.4.3.8 RXC-8 Component Drug Strength Volume (NM) 01671

Definition: This numeric field defines the volume measurement in which the drug strength concentration is contained. For example, Acetaminophen 120 MG/5ML Elixir means that 120 MG of the drug is in a solution with a volume of 5, which would be encoded in RXC-5, RXC-6, RXC-8 and RXC-9 as

RXC|||||120|mg^^ISO||5|ml^^ISO ...<cr>

==== 4A.4.3.9 RXC-9 Component Drug Strength Volume Units (CWE) 01672

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field indicates the volumetric unit associated with _RXC-8 Component Drug Strength Volume_. See example in RXC-8. Refer to Table 0701 - Component Drug Strength Volume Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 4A.4.3.10 RXC-10 Dispense Amount (NM) 03314

Definition: This field contains the amount to be dispensed as encoded by the pharmacy or treatment supplier.

==== 4A.4.3.11 RXC-11 Dispense Units (CWE) 03315

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains the units for the dispense amount as encoded by the pharmacy or treatment supplier. This field is required if the units are not implied by the actual dispense code. This must be in simple units that reflect the actual quantity of the substance dispensed. It does not include compound units. Refer to Table 0703 - Dispense Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

=== 4A.4.4 RXE - Pharmacy/Treatment Encoded Order Segment

The RXE segment details the pharmacy or treatment application's encoding of the order. It also contains several pharmacy-specific order status fields, such as _RXE-16-number of refills remaining_, _RXE-17-number of refills/doses dispensed, RXE-18-D/T of most recent refill or dose dispensed_, and _RXE-19-total daily dose._

Note that _ORC-7-quantity/timing_ has a different meaning from _RXE-1-quantity/timing_ and _RXG-3-quantity/timing_. The pharmacy or treatment department has the "authority" (and/or necessity) to schedule dispense/give events. Hence, the pharmacy or treatment department has the responsibility to encode this scheduling information in _RXE-1-quantity/timing_ and _RXG-3-quantity/timing. ORC-7-quantity/timing_ does not change: it always specifies the requested give/dispense schedule of the original order.

==== 4A.4.4.0 RXE field definitions

==== 4A.4.4.1 RXE-1 Quantity/Timing

Attention: The RXE-1 field was retained for backward compatibilty only as of v 2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7.

==== 4A.4.4.2 RXE-2 Give Code (CWE) 00317

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field identifies the medical substance or treatment that has been ordered to be given to the patient, as encoded by the pharmacy or treatment supplier; it is equivalent to _OBR-4-universal service ID_ in function. In the RXE segment, this give code must be fully encoded. The dispense fields, which define the units and amount of what is to be issued to the patient (see _RXE-10-dispense amount_ and _RXE-11-dispense units_ below) do not necessarily correlate with the instructions of what amount is to be "given" or administered with each dose, and may or may not be specified with the order. For example, the "give" part of the order may convey the field-representation of _give 250 mg of Ampicillin_, while the request to dispense part of the order may convey _issue 30 tablets of generic equivalent for this outpatient prescription_.

The coding system used is conditional on both the nature of the medical substance or treatment ordered and site-specific implementation considerations. For vaccines, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70292[_HL7 Table 0292 – Vaccines Administered_] is the preferred coding system. For non-vaccine products, the coding system may be a local implementation of file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70479[_User-defined Table 0479 – Pharmaceutical Substances_] or an external coding system. Examples of external coding systems include, but are not limited to, National Drug Codes (NDC), Medispan Generic Product Identifier (MGPI), Drug Descriptor Identifier (DDID), and other drug codes listed in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[_HL7 Table 0396 – Coding Systems_]. The following examples illustrate some code tables other than User-defined Table 0479:

NDC: 0006915404^Norvasc 10mg Tabs^NDC

DDID: 015189^Norvasc 10mg Tabs^DDID

CVX (HL70292): 30^HBIG^CVX

==== 4A.4.4.3 RXE-3 Give Amount - Minimum (NM) 00318

Definition: This field contains the ordered amount as encoded by the pharmacy or treatment supplier. In a variable dose order, this is the minimum ordered amount. In a non-varying dose order, this is the exact amount of the order.

*Note:* This field is not a duplication of the first component of the quantity/timing field, since in non-pharmacy/treatment orders, that component can be used to specify multiples of an ordered amount. +
 +
Another way to say this is that, for pharmacy/treatment orders, the quantity component of the quantity/timing field refers to what is to be given out at each service interval; thus, in terms of the RX order, that first component always defaults to 1. Hence, in the actual execution of the order, the value of 1 in the first component of the quantity/timing field always refers to one administration of the amount specified in this field (the requested Give Amount field).

==== 4A.4.4.4 RXE-4 Give Amount - Maximum (NM) 00319

Definition: In a variable dose order, this is the maximum ordered amount. In a non-varying dose, this field is not used.

==== 4A.4.4.5 RXE-5 Give Units (CWE) 00320

Definition: This field contains the units for the give amount as encoded by the pharmacy or treatment (e.g., respiratory therapy) application. Refer to Table 0715 - Give Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

*Note:* These units can be a "compound quantity"; i.e., the units may contain the word "per." For example, micrograms per KG (micg/kg) is an acceptable value, which means that the units are micrograms per KG (of body weight).

A table of standard units that contains compound units is needed. Until such a table is agreed on, a user-defined table is needed for each site.

==== 4A.4.4.6 RXE-6 Give Dosage Form (CWE) 00321

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: The dosage form indicates the manner in which the medication or treatment is aggregated for dispensing, e.g., tablets, capsules, suppositories. In some cases, this information is implied by the give code in _RXE-2-Give Code_. Use the _RXE-6-Give Dosage Form_ when the give code does not specify the dosage form. Refer to Table 0716 - Give Dosage Form in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 4A.4.4.22 RXE-22 Give Per (Time Unit) (ST) 00331

Definition: This field contains the time unit to use to calculate the rate at which the pharmaceutical is to be administered.

Format:

[width="100%",cols="17%,8%,75%",]
|===
|S<integer> |= |<integer> seconds
|M<integer> |= |<integer> minutes
|H<integer> |= |<integer> hours

|W<integer> |= |<integer> weeks
|L<integer> |= |<integer> months
|T<integer> |= |at the interval and amount stated until a total of <integer> "DOSAGE" is accumulated. Units would be assumed to be the same as in the QUANTITY field.
|INDEF |= |do indefinitely - also the default
|===

This is the same as the format specified for the DURATION component of the quantity/timing field, excluding the "X" specification.

This field is defined as conditional because it is required when the ordered substance is to be administered continuously at a prescribed rate (e.g., certain IVs). For example, if the "give amount/units" were 300 ml and the "give per" time unit were H1 (equivalent to one hour), the rate is 300ml/hr.

Definition: This field is the identifier of the medical substance/treatment ordered to be given to the patient; it is equivalent to _OBR-4-Universal service ID_ in function. See the RXE segment for a complete definition of the _RXE-2-Give code_. If the substance given is a vaccine, CVX codes may be used to code this field (see file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70292[_HL7 Table 0292 - Vaccines administered_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables).

==== 4A.4.6.5 RXG-5 Give Amount – Minimum (NM) 00318

Definition: This field contains the ordered amount as encoded by the pharmacy/treatment supplier. In a variable dose order, this is the minimum ordered amount. In a non-varying dose order, this is the exact amount of the order.

*Note:* This field is not a duplication of the first component of the quantity/timing field, since in non-pharmacy/treatment orders, that component can be used to specify multiples of an ordered amount.

Another way to say this is that, for pharmacy/treatment orders, the quantity component of the quantity/timing field refers to what is to be given out at each service interval; and thus, in terms of the RX order, that first component always defaults to 1. Hence, in the actual execution of the order, the value of 1 in the first component of the quantity/timing field always refers to one administration of the amount specified in this field (the requested Give Amount field).

==== 4A.4.6.6 RXG-6 Give Amount - Maximum (NM) 00319

Definition: In a variable dose order, this is the maximum ordered amount. In a non-varying dose order, this field is not used.

Definition: This field contains the units for the give amount. Refer to Table 0735 - Give Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

*Note:* These units can be a "compound quantity;" i.e., the units may contain the word "per." For example, micrograms per KG (micg/kg) is an acceptable value, which means that the units are micrograms per KG (of body weight).

A table of standard units that contains compound units is needed. Until such a table is agreed on, a user-defined table is needed for each site.

==== 4A.4.6.8 RXG-8 Give Dosage Form (CWE) 00321

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: The dosage form indicates the manner in which the medication/treatment is aggregated for dispensing, e.g., tablets, capsules, suppositories. In some cases, this information is implied by the give code in _RXG-4-Give Code_. Use this field when the give code does not specify the dosage form. Refer to Table 0736 - Give Dosage Form in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Definition: This field contains pharmacy/treatment supplier-generated special instructions to the provider administering the order. Refer to Table 0738 - Special Administration Instructions in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 4A.4.6.14 RXG-14 Give Per (Time Unit) (ST) 00331

Definition: This field contains the time unit to use to calculate the rate at which the pharmaceutical/treatment is to be administered.

Format:

[width="100%",cols="17%,7%,76%",]
|===
|S<integer> |= |<integer> seconds
|M<integer> |= |<integer> minutes
|H<integer> |= |<integer> hours
|D<integer> |= |<integer> days
|W<integer> |= |<integer> weeks
|L<integer> |= |<integer> months
|T<integer> |= |at the interval and amount stated until a total of <integer> "DOSAGE" is accumulated. Units would be assumed to be the same as in the QUANTITY field.
|INDEF |= |do indefinitely - also the default
|===

This is the same as the format specified for the DURATION component of the quantity/timing field, excluding the "X" specification.

Required when relevant (e.g., certain IVs). For example, if the "give amount/units" were 300 ml and the "give per" time unit were H1 (equivalent to one hour), the rate is 300ml/hr.

==== 4A.4.6.15 RXG-15 Give Rate Amount (ST) 00332

Definition: This field contains the units for _RXG-15-give rate amount_. May be composite. The ratio of the _RXG-15-give rate amount_ and _RXG-16-give rate units_ fields define the actual rate of administration. Thus, if _RXG-15-give rate amount_ = 100 and _RXG-16-give rate units_ = ml/hr, the requested rate of administration is 100 ml/hr. Refer to Table 0740 - Give Rate Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 4A.4.6.17 RXG-17 Give Strength (NM) 01126

Definition: Use when _RXG-4-Give code_ does not specify the strength. This is the numeric part of the strength, used in combination with _RXG-18-Give strength units_.

Definition: Use when _RXG-4-Give Code_ does not specify the strength. This is the unit of the strength, used in combination with _RXG-17-Give Strength_. Refer to Table 0741 - Give Strength Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

*Note:* These units can be a "compound quantity"; i.e., the units may express a quantity per unit of time. For example, micrograms per hour (micg/h) is an acceptable value. These compound units are contained in the ISO+ table. See Chapter 7 for full definition of ISO+ units.

==== 4A.4.6.19 RXG-19 Substance Lot Number (ST) 01129

Definition: This field contains the lot number of the medical substance administered.

*Note:* The lot number is the number printed on the label attached to the container holding the substance and on the packaging which houses the container. If the substance is a vaccine, for example, and a diluent is required, a lot number may appear on the vial containing the diluent; however, any such identifier associated with a diluent is not the identifier of interest. The substance lot number should be reported, not that of the diluent.

==== 4A.4.6.20 RXG-20 Substance Expiration Date (DTM) 01130

Definition: This field contains the expiration date of the medical substance administered.

*Note*: Vaccine expiration date does not always have a "day" component; therefore, such a date may be transmitted as YYYYMM.

Definition: This field contains the pharmacy system's assigned barcode number for the give occurrence. For IV orders, many pharmacy systems generate a barcode number to identify a specific bag/bottle of the order. This number can be an instance identifier; unique for the patient, drug combination, and schedule instance or it may be just a drug identifier. Refer to Table 0745 - Give Barcode Identifier in Chapter 2C for valid values.

The composition and use of the barcode number is dependent on application negotiation. An example of this field follows: The barcode number is in the following format, 9XXXXXXX000. The number '9' is a constant, XXXXXXX is seven (7) characters for a unique identifier assigned or derived from the patient account and order ID and 000 is the zero-filled three (3) character IV bottle number.

The maximum length of the first component of this field is 40 characters to allow for the maximum existing barcode length in use today. The second component contains the description of the item being coded and the third component may define the barcode type.

==== 4A.4.6.31 RXG-31 Give Tag Identifier (EI) 03393

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains an identifier for the individual product instance for the dispense occurrence. This may represent a barcode, RFID or other means of automatically-readable product instance. Repetitions represent the same instance where more than one barcode, RFID or other identification is present.

For example, the medication preparer, e.g., a semi-automated system, can inform the nurse that "for the 8.am administration event, the medication that has been assigned and available at the patient bedside has the barcode BBBBBBBBBBB." The nurse would scan the barcode to ensure that the right medication is being administered.

This differs from _RXG-25 Give Barcode Identifier_ in that RXG-25 may include other workflow content or the product at various levels of granularity. RXG-31 specifically identifies the product instance.

==== 4A.4.6.32 RXG-32 Dispense Amount (NM) 03316

Definition: This field contains the pharmacy system's assigned barcode number for the give occurrence. For IV orders, many pharmacy systems generate a barcode number to identify a specific bag/bottle of the order. This number can be an instance identifier; unique for the patient, drug combination, and schedule instance or it may be just a drug identifier. Refer to Table 0696 - Administered Barcode Identifier in Chapter 2C for valid values.

The composition and use of the barcode number is dependent on application negotiation. An example of this field follows: The barcode number is in the following format, 9XXXXXXX000. The number '9' is a constant, XXXXXXX is seven (7) characters for a unique identifier assigned or derived from the patient account and order ID and 000 is the zero-filled three (3) character IV bottle number.

The maximum length of the first component of this field is 40 characters to allow for the maximum existing barcode length in use today. The second component contains the description of the item being coded and the third component may define the barcode type.

Example: 12345678901^IV bottle^3X9

==== 4A.4.7.26 RXA-26 Pharmacy Order Type (ID) 01699

Definition: The Pharmacy Order Type field defines the general category of pharmacy order which may be used to determine the processing path the order will take.

==== 4A.4.7.29 RXA-29 Administration Tag Identifier (EI) 03396

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains an identifier for the individual product instance for the dispense occurrence. This may represent a barcode, RFID or other means of automatically-readable product instance. Repetitions represent the same instance where more than one barcode, RFID or other identification is present.

For example, the medication preparer, e.g., a semi-automatic system, can inform the nurse that “for the 8.am administration event, the medication that has been assigned and available at the patient bedside has the barcode BBBBBBBBBBB.” The nurse would scan the barcode, to ensure that the right medication is being administered.

This differs from _RXA-25 Administered Barcode Identifier_ in that RXA-25 may include other workflow content or the product at various levels of granularity. RXA-29 specifically identifies the product instance.

== 4A.5 Pharmacy/Treatment Message Examples 

The purpose of this section is to show how certain specific situations would be handled using the pharmacy/treatment protocol. The ellipses represent uncompleted details. The symbol // precedes comments for clarification.

=== 4A.5.1 Example of various levels of coding in an order

The order "_give 500 mg Ampicillin P.O. Q6H for 10 days for a total of 40 tablets_" is sent to the RX application from the OE application. This order can be coded with various levels of precision by an ordering application:

{empty}a) E-mail only version (uses only free text, _RXO-6-provider's pharmacy/treatment instructions_ or _RXO-7-provider's administration instructions_ only); fully encoded version must be re-entered or verified manually by the pharmacy or treatment application.

{empty}b) With _RXO-2-requested give amount-minimum_, _RXO-4-requested give units_, and _ORC-7-quantity/timing coded_, and _RXO-1-requested give code_ as free text.

{empty}c) With _RXO-1-requested give code_, _RXO-2-requested give amount-minimum_, _RXO-4-requested give units_, and _ORC-7-quantity/timing coded_, but where _RXO-1-requested give code_ does not include units.

{empty}d) With _RXO-1-requested give code_, _RXO-2-requested give amount-minimum_, _RXO-4-requested give units_, and _ORC-7-quantity/timing coded_, and where _RXO-1-requested give code_ does include units.

In this case, the units are optional. The rule for this case (on orders, dispense results, give results, and administration results) is as follows: if units are coded, they override or supersede the units value implied by the give code.

{empty}e) The E-mail only version of the order: no coded fields exist in the RXO.

The need for strength and strength unit fields in addition to the amount and amount units fields included in various RX_ segments requires explanation. Physicians can write a prescription for a drug such as Ampicillin in two ways. One way would be: "Ampicillin 250 mg capsules, 2 capsules four times a day." In this case the give amount would be 2, the give units would be capsules, the strength would be 250 and the strength units would milligrams.

However, the provider could also write the prescription as "Ampicillin 500 mg four times a day." In this case the give amount would be 500 and the give units would be milligrams. The strength would not be reported in the RXO segment because it is not specified; the drug could be given in two 250 mg caps or one 500 mg cap. But the pharmacist would dispense a specific capsule size and would record the strength in the RXE segment as 250 or 500, depending upon which pill size was dispensed.

=== 4A.5.5 Alternating IV order messages

Encoding Note: For readability, these examples do not show encoding of the subcomponents of the Give Codes (CWE data type) in the RXC and RXO segments. In practice, the subcomponents should be encoded as described in the HL7 specification.

{empty}a) Example #1

D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL with 20mEq KCl in every 3rd bottle. Start the KCl in the 3rd bottle of this order. Run in at a rate of 100mL/hr.

(Other message data: placer order #123, placer application ID=SMS, interval=continuous, start date/time=11/28/94 0900, no stop date/time, priority=Routine, order sequencing=Cyclical.)

This order may be expressed using a parent/child relationship. The parent order consists of an ORC (and a RXO, incompletely elaborated in this example) that contains order level information. The repeating bottle cycle of D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL followed by D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL followed by D5/0.45NaCl + 20mEq KCL 1000mL is represented by three child segments. The placer system may be treating this as a single order with two bottles, A (D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL @ 100mL/hr) and B (D5/0.45NaCl + 20mEq KCL 1000mL @ 100mL/hr), repeating in the cycle of A-A-B.

RXC|B|D5/.45NACL|1000|ML|...<cr>

RXC|A|KCL|20|MEQ|...<cr>

Discussion points:

Placer Order Number - Three alternatives must be discussed for placer order number.

{empty}1) Each child could have its own placer order number.

{empty}2) Each child could have the order number of the parent plus some appended identifier (for examples, 123A or 123.A or 123.1 etc.) that labels each child or each unique combination of ingredients.

{empty}3) In addition to the appended identifier discussed in 'B' above, a further suffix could be attached to uniquely identify each repetition of a particular member of the sequence. The example (a cycle of bottles 'A' and 'B' in the sequence A-A-B) identified the order numbers of the children as 123A1, 123A2, and 123B, thereby enabling the quantity/timing to be completely unambiguous. This could be expressed many other ways, such as 123A.1 or 123.A.1 or 123.A#1 etc. HL7 does not specify a format for the expression of order number suffixes, nor does it specify a delimiter to use for such a purpose.

Sequence Condition Value - In this example, the first child contains an asterisk (*) as the first character of the Sequence Condition Value and the third (last) child contains a pound sign (#).

The asterisk and pound sign are important for designating the first and last bottles especially when children are sent in separate messages, although this example is not constructed that way.

Note that computing the duration of the bottle is dependent upon the presence of [.underline]#all# of the following fields:

RXO-2-requested give amount-minimum

RXO-4-requested give units

RXC-3-component amount

RXC-4-component units

For cyclic IV orders, these fields are all required in order to determine how long each occurrence of a child will last.

While HL7 allows either sending the parent and children in one message or sending the parent and children in separate messages, it appears simpler and therefore recommended to have the parent and all children included in a single message. The example is constructed that way.

{empty}b) Example #2

D5W + 40mEq KCl 1000mL alternating with D5/LR + 20mEq KCl 1000mL at 125mL/hr

(Other message data: placer order #124, placer application ID=SMS, interval=continuous, start date/time=11/28/94 0900, no stop date/time, priority=Routine, order sequencing=Cyclical)

This example is a variation on the first example where two different base solutions are used. In this example, the placer system deals with this as one order with two alternating bottles, A (D5W + 40mEq KCl 1000mL @ 125mL/hr) and B (D5/LR + 20mEq KCl 1000mL @ 125mL/hr) in the cycle A-B. The principles discussed in Example #1 apply equally to this example.

The parent:

ORC|NW|124^SMS|||||1^C^^200611280900^^R^^^^C|...<cr>

RXO|Cyclic IV|...<cr>

The first child:

ORC|CH|124A^SMS|||||1^C^^^^^^^^C&124B&SMS&&&*ES+0M|124|...<cr>

RXR|IV|...<cr>

RXC|B|D5/LR|1000|ML|...<cr>

RXC|A|KCL|20|MEQ|...<cr>

{empty}c) Example #3

D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL with 20mEq KCl in every 3rd bottle. Start the KCl in the 3rd bottle of this order. Add 10mL of multi-vitamins to the one bag daily. Run in at a rate of 100mL/hr.

(Other message data: placer order #134, placer application ID=SMS, interval=continuous, start date/time=11/28/94 0900, no stop date/time, priority=Routine, order sequencing=Cyclical. Note that the encoding of the multi-vitamins statement in the above order, adding multi-vitamins to one IV bag each day, may vary by institution to put it into the first or last bottle of the day.)

This order may be expressed using a parent/child relationship. The parent order consists of an ORC (and a RXO, although one is not completely elaborated in this example) that contains order level information. The repeating bottle cycle of D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL followed by D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL followed by D5/0.45NaCl + 20mEq KCL 1000mL is represented by three child segments. This order is complicated by the request to add one component into any one of the three repeating bottles, depending upon which of the bottles will occur first on any particular day. Further complicating this order is a rate of infusion (10 hours for a 1000mL bottle) which results in a fractional number of daily administrations. Most legacy systems have a great deal of trouble accommodating orders like this within their existing database structures; however there a few vendors who now are able to handle the situation. The placer system may be treating this as a single order with two bottles, A (D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL @ 100mL/hr) and B (D5/0.45NaCl + 20mEq KCL 1000mL @ 100mL/hr), repeating in the cycle of A-A-B with a cyclical component (multi-vitamins).

Discussion points:

This method for accommodating the Multi-vitamins Daily scenario does not pretend to be the best or only way to express the message, but simply demonstrates adapting the current specification to a highly complex order without adding new components.

The Multi-vitamins component may be sent as a fourth child.

In this example, its _ORC-7-quantity/timing_ includes an interval of "Q1D" (every 1 days).

Its order number consists of the placer's parent order number plus an appended identifier ('X' in the above example) that labels this child as a special case. This convention would need to be agreed upon by sending and receiving applications.

{empty}d) Example #4

D5W + 40mEq KCl 1000mL alternating with D5/LR + 20mEq KCl 1000mL alternating with D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL. Infuse the D5W and D5/0.45 at 125mL/hr, and the D5/LR at 100mL/hr.

(Other message data: placer order #177, placer application ID=SMS, interval=continuous, start date/time=11/28/94 0900, no stop date/time, priority=Routine, order sequencing=Cyclical)

This example is another variation of Example 1 where the rate for each bottle is different, and this can be expressed within the RX segments of the children using current components. In this example, the placer system deals with this as one order with three alternating bottles, A (D5W + 40mEq KCl 1000mL @ 125mL/hr) , B (D5/LR + 20mEq KCl 1000mL @ 100mL/hr) , and C (D5/0.45NaCl 1000mL @ 125mL/hr) in the cycle A-B-C. The principles discussed in Example #1 apply equally to this example.

== 4A.7 Vaccine Trigger Events & Message Definitions 

=== 4A.7.1 Vaccine administration data

Immunization information systems (IIS) that maintain vaccination records need to be able to transmit patient-specific records of vaccine administration to other health information systems to provide access to the record at the time healthcare is given and to allow tracking of progress in reaching age-appropriate immunization coverage. The unsolicited update is the result of a vaccine administration update or delete. This message permits the transmission of immunization records from care providers to immunization registries. Messages containing immunization records carry patient identifying information in the PID segment. They may also carry parent or guardian information in the NK1 segments to help identify a child. The RXA segment is used to report the details of the immunization event: the type of vaccine (e.g., DTaP, polio, MMR), the date administered, the sequence (1st, 2nd, etc.), the amount (e.g., 0.5 ml), and location and provider of the immunization. In addition, the RXA provides a place to record the lot number, manufacturer and date of expiration of the immunization. The RXA can also be used to report the fact that a specified immunization was refused. This section references two tables (CVX and MVX as referenced in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[_HL7 Table 0396 – Coding Systems_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables) maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These tables are recommended in the U.S. for identifying the immunization in field _RXA-5-Administered Code_ and the vaccine manufacturer in field _RXA-17-substance manufacturer name_.

With the exception of _RXA-5-Administered code_ and _RXA-17-Substance manufacturer name_, the structure for the RXA segment below is identical to that documented in section _4A.4.7_, "_RXA - Pharmacy/Treatment Administration Segment_." When using the RXA segment for vaccine messages, link:#HL70292[_H__L7 Table 0292- V__acci__nes Adm__inistered_], should be used for _RXA-5- Administered code_, as noted in Section _4A.8.1.1_, "_Using RXA-5 in vaccine messages_." file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70227[_Imported Table 0227- Manufacturers of Vaccines_], should be used for _RXA-17- Substance manufacturer name_, as noted in Section _4A.8.1.2_, "_Using RXA-17 in vaccine messages_."
