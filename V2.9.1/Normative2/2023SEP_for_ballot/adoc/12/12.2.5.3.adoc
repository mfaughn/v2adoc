==== 12.2.5.3 Rule 3

In dependent segments *ADD* is the action code to use to establish the initial relationship between parent-child objects. The receiving system must be ready to handle multiple adds of the same object. An example is a Problem List of three (3) problems which is being sent. Attached to these problems are three (3) goals. Problem A has Goals 1 and 2 attached to it. Problem B has the same Goal 2 and a new Goal 3 attached to it. All of these will have the *ADD* action code in the segment, and when Problem B is transmitted with Goals 2 and 3, Goal 2 will have been previously transmitted with Problem A. The message construct would look like this:

MSH...

PID...

PRB (Problem A)

GOL (Goal 1)

GOL (Goal 2)

PRB (Problem B)

GOL (Goal 2)

GOL (Goal 3)

PRB (Problem C) (No attached goals)

When two (or more) instances of the same problem or goal segment are present in a message both such segments must have identical values for all fields.
