==== 12.2.1.2 Problem:

A *problem* of a given individual can be described by formal diagnosis coding systems (such as DRGs, NANDA Nursing Diagnosis, ICD9, DSM, etc.) or by other professional descriptions of healthcare issues affecting an individual. Problems can be short- or long-term in nature, chronic or acute, and have a status. In a longitudinal record, all problems may be of importance in the overall long-term care of an individual, and may undergo changes in status repeatedly. Problems are identified during patient visits, and may span multiple visits, encounters, or episodes of care.
