=== 10.2.1 Schedules, Appointments, Services, and Resources

The goal of this specification is to facilitate the communication of scheduling requests and information between applications. Such communication involves three main subjects: _schedules_, _appointments_, and _services and resources_. Schedules control the occurrence of certain services and the use of particular resources. They consist of a set of open, booked and blocked slots for one particular service or resource. _Open slots_ are periods of time on a schedule during which a service may occur, and/or a resource is available for use. _Booked slots_ are periods of time on a schedule that have already been reserved. _Appointments_ occupy sets of one or more booked slots on a schedule. They describe the nature of the service and/or the use of the resource, the person or persons responsible for the appointment's booking, and other information relevant to the booking and execution of an appointment. _Blocked slots_ on a schedule are periods of time during which a service or resource is unavailable for reasons other than booked appointments (for example, a piece of equipment might be unavailable for maintenance reasons).

In the context of this chapter, services and resources are those things that are controlled by schedules. _Services_ are real-world events, such as clinic appointments, the performance of which is controlled by a schedule. Often, these kinds of activities relate to the care of a patient. In other words, appointments for services often schedule a service for one or more patients. _Resources_ are tangible items whose use is controlled by a schedule. These "items" are often people, locations, or things low in supply but high in demand.
