Definition: This field contains a code describing the units of time used associated with _AIL-9 Duration._ This field should be valued according to the recommendations made in Chapters 2 and 7. If this field is not valued, the ISO base unit of seconds (code "_s_") will be assumed. Refer to Chapter 7 for a list of ISO+ and ANS+ unit codes.

As of v2.6, the known applicable external coding systems include those in the table below. If the code set you are using is in this table, then you must use that designation.
