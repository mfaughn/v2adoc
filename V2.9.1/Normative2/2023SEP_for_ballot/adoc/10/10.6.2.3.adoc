==== 10.6.2.3 SCH-3 Occurrence Number (NM) 00862

Definition: This field is used in conjunction with _SCH-1-Placer Appointment ID_ and/or _SCH-2-Filler Appointment ID_ to uniquely identify an individual occurrence (a child) of a parent repeating schedule appointment.

This field is conditionally required. If the transaction using this segment is intended to apply only to one occurrence of a repeating appointment, and an occurrence number is required to uniquely identify the child appointment (that is, the child does not have a separate and unique _SCH-1-Placer Appointment ID_ or _SCH-2-Filler Appointment ID_), then this field is required.
