==== 10.6.5.11 AIG-11 Duration (NM) 00893

Definition: This field contains the duration for which the resource is requested/scheduled for this appointment, if it is different than the overall duration of the requested/scheduled appointment. This field indicates to the application that a resource is required for a different amount of time than the appointment's overall duration. An unvalued duration indicates that the resource is required from its start date/time offset (specified in the previous two fields) until the end of the appointment. If no start date/time offset is specified, then the resource is required for the full duration of the appointment.

This field must be a positive, non-zero number. A negative number or zero (0) is nonsensical in the context of a duration.
