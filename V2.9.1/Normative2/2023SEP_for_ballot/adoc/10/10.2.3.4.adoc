==== 10.2.3.4 Types

Rather than describing why an appointment has been scheduled – as the appointment reason does – the appointment type describes the kind of appointment recorded in the schedule. This information tends to be administrative in nature. Typical appointment types might include: normal, tentative (or "penciled in"), STAT, etc.
