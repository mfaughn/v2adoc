==== 10.6.1.13 ARQ-13 Repeating Interval (RI) 00872

Components: <Repeat Pattern (CWE)> ^ <Explicit Time Interval (ST)>

Subcomponents for Repeat Pattern (CWE): <Identifier (ST)> & <Text (ST)> & <Name of Coding System (ID)> & <Alternate Identifier (ST)> & <Alternate Text (ST)> & <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> & <Coding System Version ID (ST)> & <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> & <Original Text (ST)> & <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> & <Second Alternate Text (ST)> & <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> & <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> & <Coding System OID (ST)> & <Value Set OID (ST)> & <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> & <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> & <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> & <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> & <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> & <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> & <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains the interval between repeating appointments. The default setting indicates that the appointment should occur once, if the component is not valued. If an explicit time interval is specified for the repeat pattern, then it specifies the actual time(s) at which the appointment should be scheduled. The _ARQ-11-Requested Start Date/Time Range_ ought to indicate the first repetition that should occur.

*Note:* The subcomponent delimiter defined for the Interval component of the Quantity/Timing field definition has been replaced by a component delimiter for this field.
