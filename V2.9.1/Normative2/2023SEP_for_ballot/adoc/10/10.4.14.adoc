=== 10.4.14 Notification That Patient Did Not Show Up for Scheduled Appointment (Event S26)

A notification that a patient did not show up for an appointment. For example, if a patient was scheduled for a clinic visit, and never arrived for that appointment, this trigger event can be used to set a status on the appointment record for statistical purposes, as well as to free resources assigned to the appointment (or any other application level actions that must be taken in the event a patient does not appear for an appointment).

Patient Administration events defined in Chapter 3 can be used to indicate that a patient has arrived for an appointment, e.g., A01 (admit/visit notification), A04 (register a patient), A05 (pre-admit a patient), or A10 (patient arriving - tracking) as possible examples. Similarly, Patient Administration transactions can be used to identify the end of an appointment, e.g., A03 (discharge/end visit) or A09 (patient departing - tracking) as possible examples.
