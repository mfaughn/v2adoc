Definition: This field contains a code describing the units of time used for expressing the _ARQ-9-Appointment Duration_ field. This field should be valued according to the recommendations in Chapters 2 and 7. If this component is not valued, the ISO base unit of seconds (code "_s_") is assumed. Refer to Chapter 7, Figures 7-6 through 7-9, for a list of ISO and ANSI+ unit codes.

As of v2.6, the known applicable external coding systems include those in the table below. If the code set you are using is in this table, then you must use that designation.
