==== 10.2.5.8 Placer Application

The role of the placer application in the scheduling model is also very similar to its counterpart in the Order Entry chapter. A placer application must request the booking, modification, cancellation, etc., of an appointment for a service or resource because it cannot exert any control over that service or resource on the schedule. In requesting that these appointments be booked or modified in some way, the placer application is asking the filler application to exert its control over the schedule on the placer application's behalf.
