This is a field made up of the following components: (1) the ID number, and (2) the type of number, and optionally (3) the state or province in which it is valid, if relevant, or other qualifying information. It is recommended that state qualifications use the abbreviations from the postal service of the country. The practitioner ID number type (component 2) is a user-defined table (file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70338[_User-defined Table 0338 â€“ Practitioner ID Number_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables).
