=== 1.8.10 Controlled Disclosure, Notification of Disclosed Information as Protected and Tracking Exceptions of Protected Health Information

HL7 Version 2.x standards are silent on supporting the controlled disclosure of protected health information where HL7 is the vehicle of the disclosure across multiple systems in a healthcare delivery system. It is also silent on messages that notify a user that requested information is protected and messages to track allowed exceptions that may take place at the discretion of potentially, but not certified, authorized users (e.g., a physician in the emergency room). For links to related HL7 Version 2 segments see 1.8.2.
