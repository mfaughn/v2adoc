=== 1.8.3 Department of Defense (DOD) Requirements for Systems Security and Robustness

HL7 Version 2.x standards do not attempt to support U.S. DOD Security Divisions (A, B, C, D) and Classes (1, 2, 3). If a user requires these features, they will have to define their own structures to support these classifications and insure a uniform implementation across multiple systems in an enterprise.
