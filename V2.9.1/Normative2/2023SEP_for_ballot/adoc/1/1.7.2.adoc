=== 1.7.2 Local Variations

The HL7 Version 2.x Standards are intended to standardize data interchanges, not the underlying applications systems. This means that there will be a wide variety in the manner in which the Standard is applied in different institutions.

The requirement to support diversity within the Standard is addressed in these ways:

{empty}a) The only data fields that are required in the abstract messages are those necessary to support the logic of the relationships among the messages or their basic purpose. Many other fields are specified but made optional.

{empty}b) There are provisions within the specifications to add messages or portions of messages that are local to an institution. The conventions used for this are intended to prevent conflict with future versions of the specification.
