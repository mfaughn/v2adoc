=== 1.8.23 Support for Secondary Clinical Records

HL7 Version 2.x standards do not provide specific messages to support partial replication (i.e., extraction and subsequent merger) of a patientâ€™s demographic and clinical records. This process has been identified by the IOM, JCAHO and others as an emerging requirement for the maintenance and practical use of an electronic health record system. HL7 may provide more explicit support for this concept in the future as organizations such as ASTM and CPRI develop specific definitions and requirements for this functional activity and healthcare vendors start to include this type of functionality within their individual clinical record solutions offerings.
