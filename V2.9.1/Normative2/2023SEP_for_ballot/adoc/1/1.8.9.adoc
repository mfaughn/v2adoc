=== 1.8.9 Uniform Data Definition and Data Architecture

HL7 Version 2.x standards do not include an explicit data model or composite data dictionary. However, extensive work has taken place within the HL7 Working Group to produce a data model for previous versions of HL7 2.x. While these models have not been formally balloted, they are available on the HL7 web server.
