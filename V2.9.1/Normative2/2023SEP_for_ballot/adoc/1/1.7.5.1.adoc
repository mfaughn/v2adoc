==== 1.7.5.1 Lower layer protocols

The HL7 Version 2 Encoding Rules are substantially different from the ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (BER) documented in CCITT X.409 and X.209 and ISO 8825 or those employed in LU6.2 or RPC. This is because:

{empty}a) By definition, the HL7 Version 2 encoding rules will be applied where the environment does not include software to do encoding. Without such software, the burden on applications programmers to develop messaging software that conforms to those encoding rules is onerous.

{empty}b) The encoding rules of these protocols depend on the assumption that lower level protocols provide transparency (i.e., all character codes can be transmitted without being changed by and of the lower levels). This assumption is often not met in the communications environments that must serve HL7 for the interim. The techniques that might be used to implement transparency in the Lower Level Protocol are difficult to implement in some present‑day applications environments.

The notation chosen to document the message formats in the HL7 Version 2 Standard is not the Abstract Syntax Notation1 (ASN.1) Basic Encoding Rules (BER) defined by ISO.

Contrary to other high level communications environments, there is no notion of association separate from the sending of the message from client to server and the response. This seems appropriate to the client‑server model.

Whenever HL7 Version 2 is applied in a networking environment, addressing will be an issue. This is equally true whether it is applied on ISO Standards networks or proprietary networks. Although the HL7 Standard does not specify how this addressing will occur, it does provide certain data fields that will be of value in determining addresses. The fields MSH-5 - receiving application, MSH-6 - receiving facility, and MSH-11 - processing ID are located in the header of all HL7 messages. MSH-6 - receiving facility is intended for environments in which multiple occurrences of the same application are being run on the same computer system or on the same network on behalf of different institutions or other organizational entities. MSH-11-processing ID is used in situations in which various versions of essentially the same application may reside on the same computer for different purposes. See _HL7 table 0103 - Processing ID_ for recommended values.

HL7 Version 2 does not standardize all values for MSH-5 - receiving application and MSH-6 - receiving facility at this time because there are so many variations in place in existing systems and because different kinds of environments (e.g., in different countries) may have different required code sets. However, we strongly encourage the use of the HL7 suggested code sets where they are defined and we recognize that movement toward more standardized codes is essential for seamless communications.
