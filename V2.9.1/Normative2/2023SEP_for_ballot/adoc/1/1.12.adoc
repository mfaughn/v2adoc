== 1.12 Errata

The item below constitutes the know errata at the time of publication. Users of the standard are advised to refer to the HL7 web site (http://www.HL7.org[www.HL7.org]) for a current Errata listing.

[.underline]#Issue: Use of "etc." in various segment choices#

• Resolution: The "etc." is used as a placeholder for various choice alternatives that may be represented in the abstract message syntax (AMS). "Etc." should be interpreted as meaning any segment can be used in this location; that is, "etc." does not limit your choice of segment or segment groups, except for MSH and other transmission control segments. In the future, explanation will be added to Chapter 2, section 12 proposing the use of "Hxx" as a formal representation in circumstance where a choice of any segment or segment group is allowed.

[.underline]#Issue: Use of Opening and Closing Angle Brackets around Segment Groups#

• Resolution: In the standard, we have named required and non-repeating segment groups. The standard uses opening and closing angle brackets to delineate these segment groups. This is used to indicate that you have a choice of "one of one" in these representations, effectively making them required, named segments. This formalism allows for a better representation of the standard in languages such as XML and solves the problem of attaching a name to a group.

[.underline]#Issue: Incorrect Element Definition for REL-12 Negation Indicator in Chapter 12, Section 12.4.5.12#

• Currently the definition for this element reads "This field contains the date range relevant to the assertion of the relationship." However, this is incorrect. The correct definition should read "This field, if populated and set to true, indicates that the given relationship is not true or does not exist."

• Resolution: As this change is substantive, a proposal to formally change the definition will be brought forward in Version 2.9. Until this correction can be made, users of the standard are advised to consider the alternate definition above when using this element.

[.underline]#Issue: Ambiguous Use of CWE Data Type in Element Definition for TCC-15 Test Criticality in Chapter 13, Section 13.4.9.15#

• Currently the definition for this element indicates that a CWE data type is used; however, the definition also advises that the element can be populated with "a sequential number of the test sorted according to the criticality assigned by the lab". In general practice, the CWE data type references a table of assigned values, recognizing that those values are often assigned by the user. It is expected that the definition for this element will be reviewed and revised with the next release.

[.underline]#Additional Issues Carried Forward from Version 2.9#
