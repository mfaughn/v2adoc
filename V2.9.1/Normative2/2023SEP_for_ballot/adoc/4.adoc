== 4.2 Purpose

The Order Entry transaction set provides for the transmission of orders or information about orders between applications that capture the order, by those that fulfill the order, and other applications as needed. An order is a request for material or services, usually for a specific patient. These services include medications from the pharmacy, clinical observations (e.g., vitals, I&Os) from the nursing service, tests in the laboratory, food from dietary, films from radiology, linens from housekeeping, supplies from central supply, an order to give a medication (as opposed to delivering it to the ward), etc.

Most orders are associated with a particular patient. However, the Standard also allows a department to order from another ancillary department without regard to a patient (e.g., floor stock), as well as orders originating in an ancillary department (i.e., any application may be the placer of an order or the filler of an order).

We refer to the person or entity who places the order as the placer. We refer to the person or entity that carries out the order as the filler (producer in ASTM terminology). In the case where the person or entity that carries out the order also requests the order, this person or entity is referred to as the filler and placer of the order. The filler may also request another application to assign a filler or placer order number.

This chapter defines the transactions at the seventh level, i.e., the abstract messages. Various schemes may be used to generate the actual characters that make up the messages according to the communications environment. The HL7 Encoding Rules will be used where there is not a complete Presentation Layer. This is described in Chapter 2, Section 2.6, "Message construction rules." The examples included in this chapter were constructed according to the HL7 Encoding Rules.

=== 4.2.1 Preface (organization of this chapter)

This chapter has been organized into six major sections, General, Diet, Supply, Pharmacy, Vaccine and Transfusion Services. Each section contains the trigger events, message definitions, segments and examples for the specific type of order messages. Each section about a type of order is organized into background and overview, message structure, and message segments (that are specific to the order class in question). Special discussions of the use of fields, segments or messages, and examples are included. Segments are introduced in order of occurrence in a message. A list of allowable values for a field is included in the body of the text, along with the field definition for easier reference.

*Section 4.3* refers the reader to Chapter 2 for an outline of the Quantity Timing (TQ) Data Type Definition.

*Sections 4.4 to 4.6* 'General' includes the triggers and segments for the clinical observations and diagnostic studies as well as the triggers and message segments that are common to all of the order entry messages. Orders for laboratory tests, bedside monitoring, diagnostic imaging, electrocardiograms, vital signs, etc., are subsumed under this order message set.

*Sections 4.7 to 4.9* 'Diet' includes all of the usual diet specifications including snacks and guest trays

*Sections 4.10 to 4.12* 'Supply' includes order messages for both Stock and No-stock orders. Supply orders are different in that they often are not patient-centered (e.g., requests to stock the ward supply room).

*Sections 4.13 to 4.16* 'Pharmacy / Treatment' includes all pharmacy and treatment related order messages. These sections additionally include triggers related to the dispensing, giving and administration of orders. In the development of the treatment order transaction set, the focus has been on medication treatments, but the same transaction set works well for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). There is hope that it is also sufficient for other kinds of treatment orders, such as those performed by the nursing service. But it has not yet been exercised in that context and may well need further development.

*Sections 4.17 to 4.19* 'Vaccine' includes triggers and segments specific to vaccination order messages. These sections also include RXA definitions specific to vaccination messages.

*Sections 4.20 to 4.22* "Transfusion Service (Blood Bank)" includes triggers and segments specific to transfusion service messages.

=== 4.2.2 Glossary

==== 4.2.2.0 hiddentext

==== 4.2.2.1 Filler:

The application responding to, i.e., performing, a request for services (orders) or producing an observation. The filler can also originate requests for services (new orders), add additional services to existing orders, replace existing orders, put an order on hold, discontinue an order, release a held order, or cancel existing orders

==== 4.2.2.2 Observation segment: 

An OBX segment defined in Chapter 7.

==== 4.2.2.3 Order: 

A request for a service from one application to a second application. The second application may in some cases be the same, i.e., an application is allowed to place orders with itself. In HL7 terms, an order is defined as an ORC segment in conjunction with a single order detail segment such as OBR, RXO or RXE.

==== 4.2.2.4 Order detail segment:

One of several segments that can carry order information. Examples are OBR and RXO. Future ancillary‑specific segments may be defined in subsequent releases of the Standard if they become necessary.

==== 4.2.2.5 Placer: 

The application or individual originating a request for services (order).

==== 4.2.2.6 Placer order group: 

A list of associated orders coming from a single location regarding a single patient.

==== 4.2.2.7 Order Number: 

An identifier that uniquely identifies an order as represented by an ORC segment and its matching order detail segment. Although traditionally called an order number, the identifier is not required to be all digits, it may contain alpha as well as numeric characters.

== 4.3 Quantity/Timing (TQ) Data Type Definition

*Note:* With version 2.5, the definition and narrative for the TQ – Quantity/Timing data type has been moved to Chapter 2, Section 2.A.81. This section retained in v2.6 and later to maintain consistent section numbering for reference from other chapters.

== 4.4 General Trigger Events & Message Definitions

The triggering events that follow are all served by the OMG (General Clinical Order Message), OML (Laboratory Order Message, Laboratory Order for Multiple Orders Related to a Single Specimen, Laboratory Order for Multiple Orders Related to a Single Container of a Specimen, Specimen Shipment Centric Laboratory Order), OMI (Imaging Order Message), OPL (Population/Location-Based Laboratory Order Message), OSU (Order Status Update) and OMQ (General Order Message with Document Payload) message definitions along with the following acknowledgment messages served by the ORG (General Clinical Order Acknowledgement Message), ORL (General Laboratory Order Response Message to any OML message, Laboratory Order Response Message To A Multiple Order Related To Single Specimen OML message, Laboratory Order Response Message to a Single Container of a Specimen OML message, Specimen Shipment Centric Laboratory Order Response Message to Specimen Shipment OML message), ORI (Imaging Order Response Message to Any OMI message), OPR (Population/Location-Based Laboratory Order Acknowledgment Message) and ORX (General Order Message with Document Payload Acknowledgement Message) message definitions.

Each triggering event is listed below, along with the segments that comprise the messages. The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality, and repeating of segments is described in Chapter 2, "Format for defining abstract messages."

=== 4.4.1 ORM – general order message

*_Attention: Retained for backwards compatibility only as of v2.4.and withdrawn as of v2.7. Refer to OMG, OML, OMD, OMS, OMN, OMI, and OMP instead._*

=== 4.4.2 ORR – general order response message response to any ORM 

_*Attention: Retained for backwards compatibility only as of v2.5 and withdrawn as of v2.7.* Refer to ORG, ORL, ORD, ORS, ORN, ORI, and ORP instead._

=== 4.4.3 OSQ/OSR- query response for order 

*_Attention: Retained for backwards compatibility only as of v2.4.and withdrawn as of v2.7. Refer to Chapter 5._*

=== 4.4.4 OMG – general clinical order message (event O19) 

The function of this message is to initiate the transmission of information about a general clinical order that uses the OBR segment. OMG messages can originate also with a placer, filler, or an interested third party.

The trigger event for this message is any change to a general clinical order. Such changes include submission of new orders, cancellations, updates, patient and non-patient-specific orders, etc.

This trigger includes segments identified as being for 'previous results.' These segments allow the sending system to include demographic and/or result information from previous result reports when they are related to the current order.

For example:

• Diagnostic laboratories referring tests to another lab for either confirmation of results (HIV, etc.) or due to not being equipped to do the tests (genetic testing, etc.).

• Diagnostic laboratories sending test results to Knowledge Bases for the automated generation of diagnostic comments for inclusion into the lab report.

The CTD segment in this trigger is used to transmit temporary patient contact details specific to this order.

When one wants to convey with the detailed order message a supporting document, such as a CDA, one can transmit that document using the OBX associated with the ORC/OBR(s) using OBX-11 = "O" Order Detail Description Only, using either OBX-2 = "ED" or "RP".

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

=== 4.4.5 ORG – general clinical order acknowledgement message (event O20) 

The function of this message is to respond to an OMG message. An ORG message is the application acknowledgment to an OMG message. See Chapter 2 for a description of the acknowledgment paradigm.

In ORG the PID and ORC segments are optional, particularly in case of an error response. However, ORC segments are always required in ORG when the OBR is present. For example, a response ORG might include only the MSH and MSA.

The function (e.g., cancel, new order) of both OMG and ORG messages is determined by the value in ORC-1-order control. (See the table of order control values for a complete list.)

There is not supposed to be an Application Level acknowledgement to an Application Level Acknowledgement message. In Enhanced Mode, MSH-16 SHALL always be set to NE (Never).

=== 4.4.6 OML – laboratory order message (event O21) 

The following message structure may be used for the communication of laboratory and other order messages and must be used for lab automation messages where it is required that the Specimen/Container information is within the ORC/OBR segment group.

The trigger event for this message is any change to a laboratory order. Such changes include submission of new orders, cancellations, updates, etc. OML messages can originate also with a placer, filler, or an interested third party.

Note: The additional patient information, which is sent after the OBR with the current order (the segments PID, PD1, PV1, PV2, etc, indicated below with words "previous result"), could have been transferred with the previous result because the patient demographics related to the previous result can differ from the demographics related to the current order. The current intent is to only allow references to the same patient as in the header PID.

The SAC segments included in the message allow the transfer of, e.g., a laboratory order with multiple containers and multiple test orders related to each container, or laboratory orders with test order requiring multiple containers.

Refer to Chapter 13, "Laboratory Automation" for examples of usage, particularly to clarify the use of two references to SAC segments in this one message.

The CTD segment in this trigger is used to transmit temporary patient contact details specific to this order.

The IPC segment in this trigger is used to transmit imaging process identifiers for observations that will result in DICOM information objects (e.g., slide images). Note that the IPC-1 Accession Identifier is the identifier assigned by the Order Filler for associating the DICOM results with other laboratory information and processes; it may or may not be the same as the SPM-30 Accession ID or the SAC-2 Accession Identifier.

In relationship to triggers O21, O33, O35, and O39 this message/trigger (O21) should be used where an order with multiple samples and optionally multiple containers per order item are to be communicated, but not against a complete specimen shipment (O39)

When one wants to convey with the detailed order message a supporting document, such as a CDA, one can transmit that document using the OBX associated with the ORC/OBR(s) using OBX-11 = "O" Order Detail Description Only, using either OBX-2 = "ED" or "RP".

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

=== 4.4.8 OML – Laboratory order for multiple orders related to a single specimen (event O33)

The trigger event for this message is any change to a laboratory order. Such changes include submission of new orders, cancellations, updates, etc., where multiple orders are associated with a single sample which may be carried in multiple containers. OML messages can originate also with a placer, filler, or an interested third party.

This allows for a Specimen-centric message with multiple orders per specimen grouped by the specimen.

The following message structure may be used for the communication of laboratory and other order messages and must be used for lab automation messages where the message requires Specimen/container information to group a number of orders.

____
The IPC segment in this trigger is used to transmit imaging process identifiers for observations that will result in DICOM information objects (e.g., slide images). Note that the IPC-1 Accession Identifier is the identifier assigned by the Order Filler for associating the DICOM results with other laboratory information and processes; it may or may not be the same as the SPM-30 Accession ID or the SAC-2 Accession Identifier.
____

In relationship to triggers O21, O33, and O35, this message/trigger (O33) should be used where a specimen, with optional multiple containers, may have multiple orders to be communicated.

When one wants to convey with the detailed order message a supporting document, such as a CDA, one can transmit that document using the OBX associated with the ORC/OBR(s) using OBX-11 = "O" Order Detail Description Only, using either OBX-2 = "ED" or "RP".

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

=== 4.4.10 OML – Laboratory order for multiple orders related to a single container of a specimen (event O35)

The trigger event for this message is any change to a laboratory order. Such changes include submission of new orders, cancellations, updates, etc., where multiple orders are associated with a single sample which may be carried in multiple containers. OML messages can originate also with a placer, filler, or an interested third party.

This allows for a Specimen-centric message with multiple orders per specimen grouped by the specimen.

The following message structure may be used for the communication of laboratory and other order messages and must be used for lab automation messages where the message requires Specimen/container information to group a number of orders.

____
The IPC segment in this trigger is used to transmit imaging process identifiers for obsrevations that will result in DICOM information objects (e.g., slide images). Note that the IPC-1 Accession Identifier is the identifier assigned by the Order Filler for associating the DICOM results with other laboratory information and processes; it may or may not be the same as the SPM-30 Accession ID or the SAC-2 Accession Identifier.
____

In relationship to triggers O21, O33, and O35, this message/trigger (O35) should be used for laboratory orders where there is 1 or more Specimens with 1 to many containers and each container may have 1 to many orders with previous result(s) per container.

When one wants to convey with the detailed order message a supporting document, such as a CDA, one can transmit that document using the OBX associated with the ORC/OBR(s) using OBX-11 = "O" Order Detail Description Only, using either OBX-2 = "ED" or "RP".

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

=== 4.4.14 OMI – Imaging Order Message (Event O23)

This message is used in communication between the information systems involved in the fulfillment of the request directed to the imaging department, such as a Radiology Information System (RIS) and a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). For the purpose of the following discussion these systems will be identified as Imaging Department Information Systems (IDIS). Information contained in the Imaging Procedure Control (IPC) segment allows multiple IDIS to share the context of Imaging Studies (collections of images acquired, processed, stored, and interpreted) in Image Management tasks.

The order for the imaging service is communicated between the Order Placer (such as an Order Entry system) and the Order Filler (such as an RIS). In the imaging department environment, the Order Filler also identifies the set of procedures (studies) and sub-procedures (procedure steps) that have to be performed in the process of fulfilling the order. Each sub-procedure is performed using a single device (station). The Order Filler identifies the type of device and either a specific device or group of devices (for example, by geographic location) one of which is to be used in performing the procedure step. Thus, the system performs an aspect of workflow management in the department.

Another information system in the department may be managing storage and distribution of the images within the department as well as providing them to the enterprise. This system will have to operate within the same context as the system managing the workflow. This context includes identifiers, content of the order, and details of procedures and procedure steps that have to be performed to fulfill that particular order.

When one wants to convey with the detailed order message a supporting document, such as a CDA, one can transmit that document using the OBX associated with the ORC/OBR(s) using OBX-11 = "O" Order Detail Description Only, using either OBX-2 = "ED" or "RP".

It is expected that the OMI message will typically be used in communication between IDIS as depicted in figure 4-1.

Figure 4-1 – Use of OMI message

image:extracted-media/media/image1.wmf[extracted-media/media/image1]

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

This structure represents the way that most orders to veterinary laboratories occur. There is a multi-tier hierarchy in which a single individual (usually a veterinarian or an owner of a production facility) submits one or more specimen samples from one or more animals or non-living entities, such as environmental specimens or feed, etc. There are often many interested participants referenced for each set of orders, which explains the need for the repeating PRT segment. These include individuals such as the government official that is responsible for monitoring the testing of an animal or animal group, the parent organization, etc. This grouped submission of specimens from multiple animal "patients" requires that orders pertaining to animal and non-animal specimens be accommodated. The primary structure of concern is the following:

____
\{[PID]

\{SPM

\{ORC

OBR}

}

}
____

This allows for multiple specimens or animal or non-animal origin to have multiple requests associated with them. This is the usual process in field level sample collection from populations or environments.

=== 4.4.18 Order Status Update (Event O51) 

This message is used to create simple order status updates for any type of order where the ORC is sufficient to communicate the order identifier and no other data changes. This is particularly necessary when status updates are not part of order acknowledgement messages, e.g., a status message occurs 2 days later.

Note that one also could send a regular order message using order control code “SC” (Status Changed). The choice to use one or the other is dependent on whether any of the other segments in the original message structure is necessary or not.

=== 4.4.20 OMQ – General Order Message with Document Payload (Event O57)

The purpose of this message is to enable communication of orders using a CDA document type to convey the content of the order (e.g., prescription, lab tests, etc.) while the message infrastructure enables appropriate state management.

It should be noted that, unless orders are communicated at the granular, fully decomposed test/medication/procedure/etc. level, state management can only happen at the group level, i.e., equal to all elements in the document. It also should be noted that identification of individual elements can only be achieved if the CDA document contains appropriate identification while the order numbers in ORC effectively act as a group number.

Once the order manager determines to initiate a new order using this message, then all subsequent state management messages must continue at the document level, forgoing detailed level state management.

When one wants to convey with the detailed order message a supporting document, such as a CDA, one can transmit that document using the OBX associated with the ORC/OBR(s) using OBX-11 = "O" Order Detail Description Only, using either OBX-2 = "ED" or "RP".

=== 4.4.21 ORX – General Order Message with Document Payload Acknowledgement Message (Event O58) 

The function of this message is to respond to an OMQ message. An ORX message is the application acknowledgment to an OMQ message. See Chapter 2 for a description of the acknowledgment paradigm.

In ORX the PID and ORC segments are optional, particularly in case of an error response. However, ORC segments are always required in ORD when the OBR is present. For example, a response ORD might include only the MSH and MSA.

The function (e.g., cancel, new order) of both OMQ and ORX messages is determined by the value in ORC-1-order control. (See the table of order control values for a complete list.)

=== 4.4.22 OML – Laboratory Result Interpretation Request Message (Event O59) 

This is a simplified fulfillment order representing a request for interpretation of a pre-existing result. The ORC and OBR are the new fulfillment order requesting confirmation of a previous result.

The REL segment (Ch. 12) establishes a relationship between the new order (source) and a previous order/result (target) requiring additional action such as confirmation of that order or result, or interpretation of that result. The REL segment includes a variety of fields defining a clinical relationship and the identity of the asserting party. For this use, the required fields are the relationship type (REL-2), the source identifier (REL-4, new order number in this message), and the target identifier (REL-5, previous order group, order, or result identifier included in a previous message). Targets may be represented using order or order group identifiers, in which case the target encompasses the entire order or order group and all results, or may include results identifiers (OBX-21, Observation Instance Identifier), in which case the target is restricted to the specific result.

== 4.5 General Segments

The following segments (ORC and BLG) are common to many order messages.

=== 4.5.1 ORC – Common Order Segment

The Common Order segment (ORC) is used to transmit fields that are common to all orders (all types of services that are requested).

There is some overlap between fields of the ORC and those in the order detail segments. These are described in the succeeding sections.

ORC use notes

{empty}a) placer order groups

____
The Standard supports a mechanism to collect several orders together in a group. Most often this is used to represent an "ordering session" for a single patient. A common use case is the grouping of laboratory batteries and tests ordered together by a physician for a patient with a common diagnostic goal (e.g. preoperative blood testing, diabetes follow-up, …).
____

An order group is a list of orders (ORCs) associated with an ORC-4-placer group number. A group is established when the placer supplies a placer group number with the original order or when the filler accessions the order group and supplies a filler group number with the received order. The order group may be identified by the placer or by the filler or by both applications. The order group consists of all the ORCs and order detail segments that have the same placer group number, or using the assign number/number assigned mechanism. Orders can be removed from the group using cancel, or added using the replacement or parent‑child mechanisms. New orders cannot otherwise be added to the group.

{empty}b) duplicate fields

____
The ORC is intended to uniformly define the fields that are common to all orders (i.e., requested services). Some ORC fields are duplicated in some order detail segments (e.g., OBR, RXO). For example, ORC-2-placer order number has the same meaning and purpose as OBR-2-placer order number field. This promotes upward compatibility with past versions and ASTM.

The rule for using these fields is that the value must appear in the order detail segment if it does not appear in the ORC. However, it is recommended to transmit the field value in both places to avoid confusion.
____

{empty}c) parent/child – cancel, hold, discontinue

____
During transmission of a request to cancel, hold, or discontinue a parent order, the request is intended to apply recursively to the parent order and all associated child orders.
____

For example:

{empty}1) An EKG application receives an order for three EKGs on successive mornings.

{empty}2) The EKG application creates three child orders, one for each requested EKG..

{empty}3) The first daily EKG has already been performed when a request is received to cancel the original parent order. (The parent is beyond the point of cancellation.)

{empty}4) The remaining, unperformed, children are canceled as a result of the request.

Date/Time Use Notes:

Various dates are available in ORC that seem overlapping, but serve distinct purposes. The following provides use notes on these relationships, while the individual field definitions provide further details.

• ORC-7 Quantity/Timing - This field was retained for backward compatibility only as of v 2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7. The reader is referred to the TQ1 – Timing/Quantity and TQ2 – Timing/Quantity Relationship segments described in sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.5, respectively. The purpose of this field (and now these segments) is to capture Priority, Frequency, and Timing of the service being ordered. For example, an order for a unit of blood to be administered to a patient every morning for 3 days..

• ORC-9 Date/Time of Order Event – This field is the date/time when the action indicated in ORC-1 was initiated. Every time a new action, as indicated by ORC-1, occurs the date/time of that action should appear in ORC-9. This field is not equivalent to MSH-7 Date and Time of Message, which reflects the date/time of message generation.

• ORC-15 Order Effective Date/Time – The field focuses on when the information communicated is to take effect. It is most appropriate when used on an order that is by nature a “continuing” (or continuous) order. This field has a close relationship to ORC-9 and the TQ1, TQ2 segments in so much as the value in ORC-15 takes precedence over both. For example, an order is placed on June 1, for an activity that is to be performed over ten days as indicated in the TQ1 segment. The Filler then receives a cancel message on June 2 with the ORC-9 value of June 2, but the ORC-15 Order Effective Date/Time indicated the cancel is to be effective on June 7th. ORC-15 by taking precedence over TQ1 and ORC-9, would tell the Filler to continue to perform the order event until June 7, and cancel all remaining events (treatment, procedures etc.) after that time.

• ORC-27 Filler’s Expected Availability Date/Time – This field focuses on when the filler expects to complete the order, e.g., have the results available, the prescription ready, etc. This is a Filler assigned field and would typically only be sent from Filler to Placer on either application level acknowledgments or order status messages. (Could be delivered with result messag but would have little relevance at that time.)

• ORC-32 Advanced Beneficiary Notice Date – This field contains the date the patient gave consent to pay for potentially uninsured services or the date that the Advanced Beneficiary Notice Code (ORC-20) was collected.

• ORC-36 Order Status Range – This field is a Filler assigned date/time indicating a date range that the ORC-5 Order Status is intended to be effective. For example, if the Filler recommends an alternate test, and sets the ORC-5 status to “Hold”, this date/time reflects how long the Filler will keep the order in that status (barring additional communications from the Placer or Filler in regard to this order.)

• ORC-37 Order Creation Date/Time – focuses on the date that the order was originally created; whether as an electronic order or as an initial paper requisition. This date/time is designed to preserve the creation date/time from initial order to final result, and for all stages in-between. (Acknowledgments, Updates, Cancels, etc.)

==== 4.5.1.0 ORC field definitions

==== 4.5.1.1 ORC-1 Order Control (ID) 00215

Definition: Determines the function of the order segment. Refer to E:\\V2\\v2.9 final Nov from Frank\\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70119[HL7 Table 0119 – Order Control Codes] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries. Depending on the message, the action of the control code may refer to an order or an individual service. For example, the code CA in an OMP message cancels the order. The same code in an RDS message, cancels the dispense. Very detailed explanatory notes are given at the end of this section.

This field may be considered the "trigger event" identifier for orders. The codes fall roughly into the following three categories:

{empty}a) event request – Codes like "NW" (new order) and "CA" (cancel order request) are used to initiate an event .

{empty}b) event acknowledgment – Codes like "OK" (order accepted) and "CR" (canceled as requested) are used to reply to the event request .

{empty}c) event notification – Codes like "OC" (order canceled) and "OD" (order discontinued) are used to notify other applications that an event has occurred. No application reply is necessary.

Event request codes are intended to initiate an event. Event acknowledgment codes are intended to reply to an application that requested an event. Event notification codes are intended to notify another application that, e.g., the filler has performed some action on an order that the other application, e.g., the placer, needs to know.

Fillers, placers, and other applications can use event requests, event acknowledgments, and event – notification-type trigger events interchangeably. However, certain order control codes can originate only from the filler (e.g., CR) and others can only originate from the placer (e.g., CA).

Refer file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70119[HL7 Table 0119 – Order Control Codes] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables__.__

==== 4.5.1.2 ORC-2 Placer Order Number (EI) 00216

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field is the placer application's order number.

This field is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (See Section 2.A.28, "EI – Entity Identifier"). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, "HD – Hierarchic designator"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.

There are three situations in which the true placer is somewhat arbitrary (and thus not unique):

{empty}a) in ORC-1-order control value of RO, following an RU replacement;

{empty}b) in ORC-1-order control value of CH (child orders); and

{empty}c) in ORC-1-order control value of SN (send number).

See the Table Notes under ORC-1-order control for the details of how the ORC-2-placer order number is assigned in these cases.

The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).

The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.

From that perspective each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.

If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). Note that if both ORC-2 and OBR-2 are valued then they must be valued the same; as well, if both ORC-3 and OBR-3 are valued, then they must be valued the same. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments.

It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number for the placer order number when a new order is placed or a unique number for the filler order number when an unsolicited result is initially communicated.

These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).

==== 4.5.1.3 ORC-3 Filler Order Number (EI) 00217

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field is the order number associated with the filling application. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (Section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies an order detail segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the order filler (receiving) application. This string must uniquely identify the order (as specified in the order detail segment) from other orders in a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). This uniqueness must persist over time.

The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see Section 2.A.36, "HD – hierarchic designator"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order.

A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third- party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the filler application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).

The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.

From that perspective each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.

If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). Note that if both ORC-2 and OBR-2 are valued, then they must be valued the same; as well, if both ORC-3 and OBR-3 are valued, then they must be valued the same. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments. It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number for the placer order number when a new order is placed or a unique number for the filler order number when an unsolicited result is initially communicated.

The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.

Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to "CA" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.

==== 4.5.1.4 ORC-4 Placer Order Group Number (EI) 00218

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains a unique identifier for an Order Group as referenced by the Placer application. An Order Group is a set of orders grouped together by the placer application.

The first component is a string that uniquely identifies all order groups from the placer application. A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required.

The second through fourth components constitute a placer or filler application ID identical to the analogous components of ORC-3-filler order number . Order groups and how to use them are described in detail in Section _4.5.1_, "_ORC – Common Order Segment_."

==== 4.5.1.5 ORC-5 Order Status (ID) 00219

Definition: This field specifies the status of an order. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70038[HL7 Table 0038 – Order status] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries. The purpose of this field is to report the status of an order either upon request (solicited), or when the status changes (unsolicited). It does not initiate action. It is assumed that the order status always reflects the status as it is known to the sending application at the time that the message is sent. Only the filler can originate the value of this field.

Although file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70038[HL7 Table 0038 – Order status] contains many of the same values contained in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70119[HL7 Table 0119 – Order control codes and their meaning], its purpose is different. Order status may typically be used in a message with an ORC-1-order control value of SR or SC to report the status of the order on request or to any interested party at any time.

==== 4.5.1.6 ORC-6 Response Flag (ID) 00220

Definition: This field allows the placer (sending) application to determine the amount of information to be returned from the filler. Sometimes the requested level of response may not be possible immediately, but when it is possible, the filler (receiving) application must send the information. When the field is null, D is the default value of the field. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70121[HL7 Table 0121 – Response flag] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries.

==== 4.5.1.7 ORC-7 Quantity/Timing

*_Attention: The ORC-7 field was retained for backward compatibility only as of v 2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7._* The reader is referred to the TQ1 and TQ2 segments described in sections _4.5.4_ and _4.5.5_, respectively.

==== 4.5.1.8 ORC-8 Parent Order (EIP) 00222

Components: <Placer Assigned Identifier (EI)> ^ <Filler Assigned Identifier (EI)>

Subcomponents for Placer Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Subcomponents for Filler Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field relates a child order to its parent order when a parent child order relationship exists. The parent child order mechanism is described in HL7 Table 0119 under order control code PA. This field uniquely identifies the parent order; no other information is required to link the child order with its parent order. It can be used to link the order to the results that triggered this order (e.g., a reflex order) or other order it relates to as an occurrence. This field repeats to allow linking to more than one parent, if necessary.

The first component has the same format as ORC-2-Placer Order Number (Section _link:#_OBR-2___Placer order number   (EI) [4.5.3.2],_ "link:#_OBR-2___Placer order number   (EI) [_Placer Order Number_ (EI) 00216]"). The second component has the same format as ORC-3-Filler Order Number (Section link:#_OBR-3___Filler Order Number   (EI) [_4.5.3.3_], "link:#_OBR-3___Filler Order Number   (EI) [_Filler Order Number_ (EI) 00217]"). The components of the placer order number and the filler order number are transmitted in sub‑components of the two components of this field.

Note that ORC-8 – Parent Order is equivalent to OBR-54 – Parent Order, but neither one is the same as OBR-29 – Result Observation Identifier.

Condition: Where the message has matching ORC/OBR pairs, ORC-8 and OBR-54 Must carry the same value.

==== 4.5.1.9 ORC-9 Date/Time of Order Event (DTM) 00223

Definition: This field contains the date and time of the event that initiated the current transaction as reflected in ORC-1 Order Control Code. This field is not equivalent to MSH-7 Date and Time of Message, which reflects the date/time of message generation.

Examples: When ORC-1 is “NW” this date represents the date/time when the order was placed by the ordering provider; when ORC-1 is "CA" this date represents the date/time when request for a cancellation was made by the placer, while for a "CR" this date represents the date/time when the cancellation was accepted by the filler (e.g., the change request was applied). When an ORC is included in an ORU message and ORC-1 is "RE", then the date represents the date/time when the observation(s) on the transaction were made available by the source system.

Definition: This field specifies the location (e.g., nurse station, ancillary service location, clinic, floor) where the person who entered the request was physically located when the order was entered. Note that this refers to the current transaction as reflected in ORC-1 Order Control Code. Only those subcomponents relevant to enterer's location should be valued (commonly, nursing unit; facility; building; floor). The person who entered the request is defined in ORC-10-entered by.

==== 4.5.1.15 ORC-15 Order Effective Date/Time (DTM) 00229

Definition: This field focuses on when the information communicated is to take effect. It is most appropriate when used on an order that is by nature a “continuing” (or continuous) order. This field has a close relationship to ORC-9 and the TQ1, TQ2 segments in so much as the value in ORC-15 takes precedence over both. For example, an order is placed on June 1, for an activity that is to be performed over ten days as indicated in the TQ1 segment. The Filler then receives a cancel message on June 2 with the ORC-9 value of June 2, but the ORC-15 Order Effective Date/Time indicated the cancel is to be effective on June 7th. ORC-15 by taking precedence over TQ1 and ORC-9, would tell the Filler to continue to perform the order event until June 7, and cancel all remaining events (treatment, procedures etc..) after that time. If the order identified in the ORC has children, the children which have not started should be canceled; if there is a child in process, it should be discontinued; if a child has progressed beyond the point where it can be discontinued, its status is unaffected.

==== 4.5.1.16 ORC-16 Order Control Code Reason (CWE) 00230

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains the explanation (either in coded or text form) of the reason for the order event described by the order control code (file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70119[HL7 Table 0119 - Order control codes]). Whereas an NTE after the order-specific segment (e.g., RXO, ORO, OBR) would provide a comment for that specific segment, the purpose of the order control code reason is only to expand on the reason for the order event.

ORC-16-order control code reason is typically not valued when ORC-1-order control is NW, although it could be. In the case of a canceled order, for example, this field is commonly used to explain the cancellation. A Pharmacy system that canceled a drug order from a physician because of a well-documented allergy would likely report the fact of the allergy in this field.

If it canceled the order because of a drug interaction this field might contain at least the names (and codes, if needed) of the interacting substances, the text describing the interaction, and the level of severity of the interaction.

Definition: This field is a modifier or refiner of the ORC-5-Order status field. This field may be used to provide additional levels of specificity or additional information for the defined order status codes. Unlike the Order Status field, which is controlled by an HL7 defined table, this field is a CE data type allowing applications to support an unlimited library of Order Status Modifier codes.

Usage Rule: This field may only be populated if the ORC-5-Order Status field is valued.

Examples: An LIS processing an order with an order status of IP may send an update using the order status modifier to indicate the progress of the order through the laboratory or to indicate that the order has been sent to an external laboratory. Another example using the non-medical orders would be a case in which a phone has been ordered delivered to a patient's room but has been disconnected temporarily. The ORC-5-Order status indicates IP and the ORC-25-Order status modifier would indicate a disconnected status. A third example involves pharmacy dispenses. It is sometimes not enough to know that a prescription is being dispensed. The ORC-25-Order status modifier would indicate if a label had been printed, the prescription filled, or the prescription sold.

==== 4.5.1.34 ORC-34 Order Workflow Profile (EI) 03387

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

The Order Workflow Profile references/represents the information necessary to define the workflow variant when that is not fully described through the use of ORC-1 Order Control and MSH-21 Message Profile. This enables contributing systems to apply locally agreed to rules. See file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70934[User-defined Table 0934 - Order Workflow Profile] for a list of suggested values.

The action code can only be used when either ORC-2 and/or ORC 3 is valued with a unique identifier in accordance with Chapter 2, Section 2.10.4.2.

==== 4.5.1.36 ORC-36 Order Status Date Range (DR) 03509

Components: <Range Start Date/Time (DTM)> ^ <Range End Date/Time (DTM)>

Definition: This field is a Filler assigned date/time indicating a date range that the ORC-5 Order Status is intended to be effective. For example, if the Filler recommends an alternate test, and sets the ORC-5 status to “Hold”, this date/time reflects how long the Filler will keep the order in that status (Barring additional communications from the Placer or Filler in regard to this order.) When the date is outside the specified order status date range, ORC-5 (Order Status) should be considered an unspecified status, i.e., the status represented in ORC-5 would not necessarily be reflective of the actual status anymore.

==== 4.5.1.37 ORC-37 Order Creation Date/Time (DTM) 03515

Definition: This field represents the official date/time when the order was originally created; whether as an electronic order or as an initial paper requisition. This may also be known as Prescription Date/Time. This date/time is designed to preserve the creation date/time from initial order to final result, and for all stages in-between. (Acknowledgments, Updates, Cancels, Results etc.). When ORC-1 Order Control Code is “NW” for a new order, this date/time, if valued, is typically expected to be the same as ORC-9 Date/Time of Order Event. An example where the ORC-37, Order Creation Date/Time, is not the same as ORC-9, Date/Time of Order Event, while ORC-1, Order Control Code, is “NW” is when the order originally was and signed by a physician on paper (ORC-37), but not entered in a system until some time (ORC-9) thereafter.

As different date/times can be considered the initiation of the order (the first person entering it or a subsequent step), or data is not available (e.g., a paper request without a date/time when it was created), the system where the order was first documented determines which date/time it reflects according to the organization's policies and would represent that in ORC-37. +
When an order is resulted (ORC-1 = “RE”) the value in ORC-37 does not change from the value supplied in the original order.

==== 4.5.1.38 ORC-38 Filler Order Group Number (EI) 02482

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains a unique identifier for the Order Group as referenced by the Filler application. An Order Group is a set of orders grouped together by the placer application.

The first component is a string that uniquely identifies all order groups from the filler application. A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required.

The second through fourth components constitute a filler application ID identical to the analogous components of ORC-3-filler order number . Order groups and how to use them are described in detail in Section _4.5.1_, "_ORC – Common Order Segment_."

=== 4.5.2 BLG – Billing Segment

The BLG segment is used to provide billing information, on the ordered service, to the filling application.

=== 4.5.3 OBR – Observation Request Segment 

General (taken from ASTM E1238)

The Observation Request (OBR) segment is used to transmit information specific to an order for a diagnostic study or observation, physical exam, or assessment.

The Observation Request segment defines the attributes of a particular request for diagnostic services (e.g., laboratory, EKG) or clinical observations (e.g., vital signs or physical exam). When a placer requests a given set of observations, always include an order segment. For lab tests, the information in the order segment usually applies to a single specimen. However, there is not a one-to-one relationship between specimen and tests ordered. Different test batteries will usually require their own order segments even when they can be performed on a single specimen. In this case, the specimen information must be duplicated in each of the order segments that employ that specimen. For other diagnostic studies, e.g., chest X-ray, a separate order segment will usually be generated for each diagnostic study.

Though multiple observation batteries can be ordered on a single order segment, the observation filler shall generate a separate order segment for each battery that it processes independently, e.g., electrolyte, CBC, vital signs. When reporting the observations, the filling service shall copy the appropriate order (specimen) information from the original order segment into each of the new order segments so that a separate "order" segment is returned to the placer as a "header" for each separate battery of observations.

In the event that an ordered battery of observations cannot be performed, e.g., because of hemolysis on a blood sample, an order segment will be returned to the placer with OBR-25-result status equal to X (to indicate that the study was not performed). In this case, no observation segments will be transmitted.

When observations are successfully completed, the message returned to the placer will include the order segment (OBR) followed by observation (OBX) segments for each distinct observation generated by the order (see Chapter 7). The number of such observation segments will depend upon the number of individual measurements performed in the process.

OBX segments can be sent by the placer along with an order to provide the filling service with clinical data needed to interpret the results. (See Chapter 7 for OBX details.)

==== 4.5.3.0 OBR field definitions

The daggered (+) items in this segment are created by the filler, not the placer. They are valued by the filler as needed when the OBR segment is returned as part of a report.

The starred (*) fields are only relevant when an observation is associated with a specimen. These are completed by the placer when the placer obtains the specimen. They are completed by the filler when the filler obtains the specimen.

OBR-7-observation date/time and OBR-8-observation end date/time (flagged with #) are the physiologically relevant times. In the case of an observation on a specimen, they represent the start and end of the specimen collection. In the case of an observation obtained directly from a subject (e.g., BP, Chest X-ray), they represent the start and end time of the observation.

==== 4.5.3.1 OBR-1 Set ID – OBR (SI) 00237

Definition: For the first order transmitted, the sequence number shall be 1; for the second order, it shall be 2; and so on.

==== 4.5.3.2 OBR-2 Placer order number (EI) 00216

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field is identical to ORC-2-Placer Order Number.

This field is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (Chapter 2A, section 2.A.28). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (section 2.A.36, "HD – Hierarchic designator"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.

See ORC-2-placer order number (section _4.5.1.2_) for information on when this field must be valued.

A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).

The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.

From that perspective, each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.

If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). If both segments contain either ORC-2/OBR-2 or ORC-3/OBR-3, then each pair must be a matching pair. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments.

It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated.

These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).

==== 4.5.3.3 OBR-3 Filler Order Number (EI) 00217

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field is the order number associated with the filling application. This is a permanent identifier for an order and its associated observations. It is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (see Chapter 2, section 2.A.28, "EI – entity identifier").

The first component is a string that identifies an individual order segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the order filling (receiving) application. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). This uniqueness must persist over time.

The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, "HD – hierarchic designator"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order.

See ORC-3-filler order number for information on when this field must be valued.

The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.

From that perspective, each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.

If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). If both segments contain either ORC-2/OBR-2 or ORC-3/OBR-3, then each pair must be a matching pair. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments.

It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated.

The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.

Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to "CA" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.

==== 4.5.3.7 OBR-7 Observation Date/Time (DTM) 00241

Definition: This field is the clinically relevant date/time of the observation. In the case of observations taken directly from a subject, it is the actual date and time the observation was obtained. In the case of a specimen‑associated study, this field shall represent the date and time the specimen was collected or obtained. (This is a results-only field except when the placer or a third party has already drawn the specimen.) This field is conditionally required. When the OBR is transmitted as part of a report message, the field *must* be filled in. If it is transmitted as part of a request *and* a sample has been sent along as part of the request, this field must be filled in because this specimen time is the physiologically relevant date/time of the observation.

==== 4.5.3.8 OBR-8 Observation End Date/Time (DTM) 00242

Definition: This field contains the end date and time of a study or timed specimen collection. If an observation takes place over a substantial period of time, it will indicate when the observation period ended. For observations made at a point in time, it will be null. This is a results field except when the placer or a party other than the filler has already drawn the specimen.

This field is used to indicate the date and time that the results are composed into a report and released, or that a status, as defined in ORC-5 order status, is entered or changed. (This is a results field only.) When other applications (such as office or clinical database applications) query the laboratory application for un-transmitted results, the information in this field may be used to control processing on the communications link.

==== 4.5.3.25 OBR-25 Result Status (ID) 00258

Definition: This field contains the status of results for this order. This conditional field is required whenever the OBR is contained in a report message. It is not required as part of an initial order.

There are two methods of sending status information. If the status is that of the entire order, use ORC-15-order effective date/time and ORC-5-order status. If the status pertains to the order detail segment, use OBR-25-result status and OBR-22-results rpt/status chng – date/time. If both are present, the OBR values override the ORC values.

This field would typically be used in a response to an order status query where the level of detail requested does not include the OBX segments. When the individual status of each result is necessary, OBX-11-observ result status may be used.

Subcomponents for Parent Observation Sub-identifier (OG): <Original Sub-Identifier (ST)> & <Group (NM)> & <Sequence (NM)> & <Identifier (ST)>

Definition: This field is defined to make it available for other types of linkages (e.g., toxicology). This important information, together with the information in OBR-29-Parent Result Obersvation Identifier and OBR-54 Parent Order__,__ uniquely identifies the parent result's OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports, or the specific result for which this order or observation is a reflex. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result which identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization. In the case of a reflex order, if it is necessary to point to the specific result value for which it is in response, OBR-26 enables pointing to that specific OBX segment.

The third component may be used to record the name of the microorganism identified by the parent result directly. The organism in this case should be identified exactly as it is in the parent culture.

We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.

This field is present only when the parent result is identified by OBR-29- Result Observation Identifier or OBR-54, Parent Order, and the parent spawns child orders or results for each of many results. (See Chapter 7 for more details about this linkage.)

A second mode of conveying this information is to use a standard observation result segment (OBX). If more than one organism is present, OBX-4-observation sub-ID is used to distinguish them. In this case, the first OBX with subID N will contain a value identifying the Nth microorganism, and each additional OBX with subID N will contain susceptibility values for a given antimicrobial test on this organism.

Definition: This field contains the procedure code modifier to the procedure code reported in OBR-44-procedure code, when applicable. Procedure code modifiers are defined by regulatory agencies such as CMS and the AMA. Multiple modifiers may be reported. The modifiers are sequenced in priority according to user entry. In the USA, this is a requirement of the UB and the 1500 claim forms. Multiple modifiers are allowed and the order placed on the form affects reimbursement. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70340[Externally- defined table 0340 – Procedure code modifier] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

Usage Rule: This field can only be used if OBR-44 – procedure code contains certain procedure codes that require a modifier in order to be billed or performed. For example, HCPCS codes that require a modifier to be precise.

As of version 2.6, applicable external coding systems include those in the referenced table. If the code set used is in the referenced table, then the coding scheme designation in the table shall be used.

=== 4.5.4 TQ1 – Timing/Quantity Segment

The TQ1 segment is used to specify the complex timing of events and actions such as those that occur in order management and scheduling systems. This segment determines the quantity, frequency, priority and timing of a service. By allowing the segment to repeat, it is possible to have service requests that vary the quantity, frequency and priority of a service request over time.

Use cases showing when TQ1 may need to repeat:

{empty}a) Cardiac enzymes STAT and then q 4 hours.

{empty}b) Streptokinase studies, draw 1^st^ Stat and run Stat, then draw q 4 hours and run Stat.

{empty}c) Gentamicin 100mg Now and 80mg q12h second dose (First 80mg dose) given exactly 12 hours after the 100mg dose. (Might be 2 service requests.)

{empty}d) Activase 15mg bolus Stat then 50mg over 30 minutes, then 35mg over the next 60 minutes. (Might be 2 service requests.)

{empty}e) Imodium 4mg (2 caps) po initially, then 2mg (1cap) after each unformed stool to a maximum of 16 mg per day. (Might be 2 service requests.)

{empty}f) Zithromax 500mg (2tabs) po on the first day then 250mg (1tab) po qd for 5 days. (Might be 2 service requests.)

{empty}g) Zyban (Bupropion) Start 150mg po qam x 3 days, then increase to 150mg po bid for 7 to 12 weeks.

{empty}h) Colchicine 1mg (2 tabs) po now then 1 tablet q1 to 2 hours until pain relief or undesirable side effects (Diarrhea, GI upset). (Might be 2 service requests.)

{empty}i) doxycylcine 100mg po bid on the first day then 100mg po qd.

{empty}j) scopolamine, xxx mg, 1 hour before surgery. Relative time = -1^hour, priority = P (preop), or alternately repeat pattern = P1H^Preop, 1 Hour before Surgery^99LocalCode, Relative time would be empty and priority would be P (preop).

Definition: This field specifies the numeric quantity of the service that should be provided at each service interval. For example, if two blood cultures are to be obtained every 4 hours, the quantity would be '2', or if three units of blood are to be typed and cross-matched, the quantity would be '3'. The default value for this field is '1'.

If multiple identical services are to be requested, it is strongly recommended that multiple service requests be placed, giving each service request its own unique placer/filler number.

Definition: The repeating frequency with which the treatment is to be administered. It is similar to the frequency and SIG code tables used in order entry systems.

This field may be repeated to build up more complex repeat patterns. For example, daily at bedtime can be represent as "|QD~HS|".

When the quantity timing specification must change to a different repeat pattern after some period of time, a new TQ1 segment must be used to show the new repeat pattern. Note that the end date of the current TQ1 will show when the current timing specification ends, and the start date of the next TQ1 shows when the new timing specification begins. The Conjunction field, TQ1-12 determines if the next TQ1 segment is to be performed sequentially or in parallel.

==== 4.5.4.4 TQ1-4 Explicit Time (TM) 01630

Definition: This field explicitly lists the actual times referenced by the code in TQ1-3. This field will be used to clarify the TQ1-3 in cases where the actual administration times vary within an institution. If the time of the service request spans more than a single day, this field is only practical if the same times of administration occur for each day of the service request. If the actual start time of the service request (as given by TQ1-7) is after the first explicit time, the first administration is taken to be the first explicit time after the start time. In the case where the patient moves to a location having a different set of explicit times, the existing service request may be updated with a new quantity/timing segment showing the changed explicit times.

Usage Note: This field is not valued if a _Repeat Pattern_ is not present.

Definition: This field is used to define the interval between schedules for service request or bottle records. If this field contains a value, it overrides any value in the explicit time interval field. The units component of the CQ data type is constrained to units of time.

Examples:

TQ1|1|1|Q1H||60^min&&ANS+ - Q1H is defined with an interval between services of 60 minutes

TQ1|1|1|Q6H||6^hr&&ANS+ - Q6H is defined with an interval between services of 6 hours

==== 4.5.4.7 TQ1-7 Start Date/Time (DTM) 01633

Definition: This field may be specified by the requester, in which case it indicates the earliest date/time at which the services should be started. In many cases, however, the start date/time will be implied or will be defined by other fields in the service request record (e.g., urgency ‑ STAT). In such a case, this field will be empty.

The filling service will often record a value in this field after receipt of the service request, however, and compute an end time on the basis of the start date/time for the filling service's internal use.

==== 4.5.4.8 TQ1-8 End Date/Time (DTM) 01634

Definition: When filled in by the requester of the service, this field should contain the latest date/time that the service should be performed. If it has not been performed by the specified time, it should not be performed at all. The requester may not always fill in this value, yet the filling service may fill it in on the basis of the instruction it receives and the actual start time.

Regardless of the value of the end date/time, the service should be stopped at the earliest of the date/times specified by either the duration or the end date/time.

Definition: This field contains the total number of occurrences of a service that should result from this service request. If both the end date/time (TQ1-8) and the total occurrences are valued and the occurrences would extend beyond the end date/time, then the end date/time takes precedence. Otherwise the number of occurrences takes precedence.

Example: Whirlpool twenty minutes three times per day for three days. The total occurrences would be 9.

=== 4.5.5 TQ2 – Timing/Quantity Relationship Segment

The TQ2 segment is used to form a relationship between the service request the TQ1/TQ2 segments are associated with, and other service requests. The TQ2 segment will link the current service request with one or more other service requests.

There are many situations, such as the creation of a service request for a group of intravenous (IV) solutions, where the sequence of the individual intravenous solutions (each a service in itself) needs to be specified, e.g., hyperalimentation with multi-vitamins in every third bottle.

There are other situations where part of the service request's instructions contains a results condition of some type, such as "PRN pain." There is currently a free text "condition" field of TQ1-10 - Condition text which allows any condition to be specified. However, to support a fully encoded version of service request sequencing, or results condition, the TQ2, Timing/Quantity Relationship segment has been defined.

TQ2 Usage notes:

{empty}a) Cyclic placer service request groups

____
To implement a cyclic group of four IV service requests using the parent/child paradigm, the parent specifies a custom group of IVs, and the following occurs:
____

{empty}i. TQ2 of the second child service request specifies that it follow the first child service request.

{empty}ii. TQ2 of the third child service request specifies that it follow the second child service request.

{empty}iii. TQ2 of the fourth child service request specifies that it follow the third service request.

____
To repeat the group of four child service requests in a cyclic manner, the following occurs:
____

{empty}iv. _TQ2_ of the first child service request specifies that it is to be executed once without any dependence on the completion of other service requests. Its second execution follows the completion of the fourth service request. See example in Section 4A.5.2 _RXO segment field examples_.

____
This scheme allows the following to be tracked:
____

• The status of the whole group of service requests to be reported back at the level of the parent service request.

• The status for each individual IV service request by following the status of the corresponding child service request.

____
Separate Service requests example:
____

• The same group of service requests can be sent as a group of four service requests (without a common parent), linked only by the data in their quantity/timing fields. In this case, there is no convenient HL7 method of transmitting the service request status of the group as a whole without transmitting the status of each of the four separate service requests.

{empty}b) Inheritance of service request status

____
Cancellation/discontinuation/hold service request control events:
____

{empty}v. This logic implies the normal execution of the referenced predecessor service request. Thus a cancel (or discontinuation or hold) of a predecessor service request implies the cancellation (or discontinuation or hold) of all subsequent service requests in the chain.

{empty}vi. If the referenced service request has been canceled (or discontinued or held), the current service request inherits that same status.

{empty}vii. In the case of hold, the removal of the hold of the predecessor implies a removal of the hold for the given service request (which can then be executed according to the specification in the TQ2 segment).

==== 4.5.6.0 IPC field definitions

==== 4.5.6.1 IPC-1 Accession Identifier (EI) 01330

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: A workflow-management IDIS generated number that identifies the Filler Order for an Imaging Service (Imaging Service Request). This identifier corresponds one-to-one to the Order Filler number but is used in internal tracking of the work by the IDIS and in communication between IDIS within the department. It also has specific requirements to assure its compatibility with DICOM. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies the Imaging Service Request. A limit of sixteen (16) characters is required to allow compatibility with DICOM. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0008,0050) that conveys information identical to the component one of this field.

An IDIS that performs functions of the workflow management for a department may accept a single Placer Order that gives rise to one or more Filler Orders-Imaging Service Requests. For example, an IDIS may receive an order for an X-ray examination of the patient daily at 8 am for the next three days. For the purposes of fulfilling the Placer Order, it will identify each of the daily exams either as a separate Filler Order or parts of a single Filler Order. Correspondingly, it will assign one or more Filler Order numbers associated with the order. For each of the Filler Order numbers, it will assign a unique Accession Number.

Each of the Imaging Service Requests may contain one or more Requested Procedures that it will identify with the Requested Procedure ID. The Requested Procedure is the most granular unit of work that may lead to the creation of the procedure report. Each procedure report contributes to the results for the order. In the example mentioned above, each of the daily examinations will require a separate diagnostic report, hence each of them will be treated as a separate Requested Procedure. Depending on the treatment of the order by the IDIS, it will either link all Requested Procedures to a single Filler Order-Imaging Service Request, or link each Requested Procedure to its own Imaging Service Request. Exact type of requested procedure is conveyed by the coded values in OBR-44 Procedure Code and OBR-45 Procedure Code modifier for each procedure. Note that in case of multiple Requested Procedures corresponding to one order, each procedure may have different code.

To support communication with the instances of equipment in a department (acquisition modalities), IDIS will also generate the Study Instance UID, a globally unique identifier for each Requested Procedure. This identifier will be used by acquisition modalities to identify all generated images and other DICOM objects related to this Requested Procedure. Note that, unlike the Study Instance UID, the Requested Procedure ID must only be unique within the scope of the encompassing Imaging Service Request identified by an Accession Number.

Each of the Requested Procedures may be further broken down by the IDIS into the Scheduled Procedure Steps based on the timing and equipment requirements. Each step is identified with the Scheduled Procedure Step ID. A single Procedure Step may only be performed on a single type and instance of the equipment. Thus, while the Requested Procedure may identify multi-modality examination (such as ones common in Nuclear Medicine), a single Procedure Step shall correspond to the operations performed on a single modality.

The example of the hierarchy of Imaging Service Request, Requested Procedure and Scheduled Procedure Step is depicted in a figure 4-6. Identifiers of the entities are represented by the field names stated in square brackets.

Figure 4-6. Hierarchy of Imaging Service Request, Requested Procedure and Scheduled Procedure Step

image:extracted-media/media/image2.wmf[extracted-media/media/image2]

The full hierarchy constitutes the context that will be shared between all IDIS within a department in a course of order fulfillment.

Each OMI message shall convey information about Requested Procedure(s) pertaining to one order. A pair of Segments ORC/OBR shall correspond to each requested procedure. If the Requested Procedure is comprised of multiple Procedure Steps, multiple IPC segments shall be included for each ORC/OBR pair in the message. Value of the IPC-1 field shall be identical in all IPC segments.

Considering the preceding example of X-ray examinations on subsequent days with two different steps identified for the last Requested Procedure and examinations to be performed at the site, "RADIOLOGY", the communication of the information using OMI message may look like the following:

==== 4.5.6.2 IPC-2 Requested Procedure ID (EI) 01658

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field is the identifier of the Requested Procedure that the workflow management IDIS selected to perform as a part of the order for the imaging service. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (section 2.A.28). The first component of this field is a string that identifies the Requested Procedure. A limit of sixteen (16) characters is required to allow compatibility with DICOM. This string must uniquely identify the Requested Procedure within the scope of the order (as specified by accession number). This uniqueness must persist over time. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0040,0001) that conveys information identical to the component one of this field.

The second through fourth components contain the ID of the workflow management IDIS, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, "HD - hierarchic designator"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of five (5) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the Requested Procedure number always identifies the actual filler of an order.

A Requested Procedure is an instance of a Procedure of a given Procedure Type. An instance of a Requested Procedure includes all of the items of information that are specified by an instance of a Procedure Plan that is selected for the Requested Procedure by the imaging service provider. This Procedure Plan is defined by the imaging service provider on the basis of the Procedure Plan templates associated with the considered Procedure Type. An Imaging Service Request may include requests for several different Requested Procedures. The purpose of this entity is to establish the association between Imaging Service Requests and Procedure Types, to convey the information that belongs to this association and to establish the relationships between Requested Procedures and the other entities that are needed to describe them. A single Requested Procedure of one Procedure Type is the smallest unit of service that can be requested, reported, coded and billed. Performance of one instance of a Requested Procedure is specified by exactly one Procedure Plan. A Requested Procedure leads to one or more Scheduled Procedure Steps involving Protocols as specified by a Procedure Plan. A Requested Procedure may involve one or more pieces of equipment.

Each OMI message shall convey information about Requested Procedure(s) pertaining to one order. Pair of Segments ORC/OBR shall correspond to each requested procedure. If the Requested Procedure is comprised of multiple Procedure Steps, multiple IPC segments shall be included for each ORC/OBR pair in the message. In this case, the value of the IPC-2 field shall be identical in all IPC segments related to the same Requested Procedure.

==== 4.5.6.3 IPC-3 Study Instance UID (EI) 01659

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: Globally unique identifier assigned by the workflow management IDIS to the Imaging Study under which all images and other DICOM objects produced in the course of the Requested Procedure shall be collected. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies the Study. A limit of sixty-four (64) characters is required to allow compatibility with DICOM. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0020,000D) that conveys information identical to component one of this field. The second through fourth components contain the ID of the workflow management IDIS, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, "HD - hierarchic designator"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of five (5) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the Study Instance UID always identifies the actual filler of an order.

Each OMI message shall convey information about Requested Procedure(s) pertaining to one order. Pair of Segments ORC/OBR shall correspond to each requested procedure. If the Requested Procedure is comprised of multiple Procedure Steps, multiple IPC segments shall be included for each ORC/OBR pair in the message. In this case, the value of the IPC-3 field shall be identical in all IPC segments related to the same Requested Procedure.

==== 4.5.6.4 IPC-4 Scheduled Procedure Step ID (EI) 01660

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field is the identifier of a particular Procedure Step (sub-procedure) of the Requested Procedure that the workflow management IDIS selected to perform as a part of the order for imaging service. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies the Procedure Step. A limit of sixteen (16) characters is required to allow compatibility with DICOM. This string must uniquely identify the Procedure Step within the scope of the Requested Procedure. This uniqueness must persist over time. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0040,0009) that conveys information identical to the component one of this field.

The second through fourth components contain the ID of the workflow management IDIS, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, "HD - hierarchic designator"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of five (5) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the Requested Procedure number always identifies the actual filler of an order.

A Procedure Step is an arbitrarily defined scheduled unit of service, which is specified by the Procedure Plan for a Requested Procedure. A Procedure Step prescribes Protocol that may be identified by one or more protocol codes. A Procedure Step involves equipment (e.g., imaging Modality equipment, anesthesia equipment, surgical equipment, transportation equipment), human resources, consumable supplies, location, and time (e.g., start time, stop time, duration). While in the context of Imaging Service request the scheduling of a Procedure Step might include only a general designation of imaging Modality that could be satisfied by multiple pieces of the same equipment type, the performance of one instance of a Procedure Step involves one and only one piece of imaging Modality equipment.

== 4.6 General Message Examples

The purpose of this section is to show how certain specific situations would be handled using the order entry protocol. The ellipses represent uncompleted details. The symbol // precedes comments for clarification.

=== 4.6.1 An order replaced by three orders

Suppose that an application called "PC" is sending an order to the EKG application for three EKGs to be done on successive days.

The order might be placed as follows:

ORM message:

MSH|...<cr>

PID|...<cr>

ORC|NW|A226677^PC||946281^PC||N|3^QAM||200601121132|444-44-4444^HIPPOCRATES^HAROLD^^^^MD|||4EAST|...<cr>

// EKG order

OBR|1|||8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION^LN||||||||||||222-33-4444^PUMP^PATRICK^^^^MD|||||||||||3^QAM|...<cr>

BLG|...<cr>

ORC|NW|...<cr>

// Another order yet others may follow

There is a group number first component indicating that an order group is being created.

Responses: Because the EKG application must turn the single order above into three orders for three separate EKGs (services), the results of each will be reported under its own OBR segment. Several response levels are possible depending on the Response Flag:

{empty}a) If the Response Flag is N (as it is), then the filler EKG application only responds "I got the order."

MSH|...<cr>

MSA|...<cr>

The only implication of this response is that the order was received.

If the Response Flag had been E, then the response would have been the same, but its implication would have been that the EKG application had processed all the orders and they were acceptable.

{empty}b) If the Response Flag were R, then the filler EKG application must communicate to the PC the fact of the creation of child orders, but with no details:

MSH|...<cr>

MSA|...<cr>

ORC|PA|A226677^PC|89‑458^EKG|946281^PC<cr>

ORC|CH|A226677^PC|89‑551^EKG|946281...<cr> // 1ST child ORC.

ORC|CH|A226677^PC|89‑552^EKG|946281...<cr> // 2ND child ORC.

ORC|CH|A226677^PC|89‑553^EKG|946281...<cr> // 3RD child ORC.

... // Other parts of follow.

What has been said here is "Your A226767 has spun out three children named 89‑551, 89‑552, and 89‑553." Notice that the placer order numbers are identical in the children's ORCs.

{empty}c) If the Response Flag were D, then the filler EKG application must communicate to the PC application the fact of the replacement and also the exact replacement order segments:

MSH|...<cr>

MSA|...<cr>

ORC|PA|A226677^PC|89‑458^EKG<cr>

ORC|CH|A226677^PC|89‑551^EKG|946281^PC|SC|||A226677&PC^89-458&EKG|

... ^^^^198901130500^...<cr>

// 1ST child ORC

OBR|1||89‑551^EKG|8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION^LN|...<cr>

// 1ST child OBR

ORC|CH|A226677^PC|89-522^EKG|946281^PC|SC|||A226677&PC^89-458&EKG|

... ^^^^198901140500^...<cr>

// 2ND child ORC

OBR|2||89‑552^EKG|8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION^LN|...<cr>

// 2ND child OBR

ORC|CH|A226677^PC|89‑553^EKG|946281^PC|SC|||A226677&PC^89-458&EKG|

...^^^^198901150500^...<cr>

// 3RD child ORC

OBR|3||89‑553^EKG|8601-7^EKG IMPRESSION^LN|... <cr>

// 3RD child OBR

// Other parts might follow

Here the actual OBR segments have been added.

The status of the child orders is being reported as SC (scheduled).

ORC-7-quantity/timing shows that the EKGs are requested after 0500 on successive days.

=== 4.6.2 Ordering non-medical services

The patient requests hospital specific services for a certain period of time. This can be a phone, fax, or TV in the room, or the delivery of a newspaper every day. Another example may be the use of specialized chip cards that give access to hospital specific services. Typically, a request for these services is made at the time of admission. Another example may be the printing of a form (e.g., the receipt for a payment). In case of using phones it might be a detailed list of calls for a patient or for a special extension.

To support these scenarios, the following fields are used to communicate the appropriate message:

[width="100%",cols="31%,69%",]
|===
|Segment/Field |Definition
|ORC-1 |Order Control
|ORC-2 |Placer Order Number
|ORC-5 |Order Status
|TQ1-7 |Start Date/Time
|TQ1-8 |End Date/Time
|ORC-16 |Order Control Code Reason
|ORC-25 |Order Status Modifier
|OBR-4 |Universal Service ID
|OBX-5 |Observation Value
|FT1-17 |Fee Schedule
|FT1-11 |Transaction amount – extended
|BLG |Billing segment
|===

• ORC-1, ORC-2, OBR-4, OBX-5 +
These services can be started, discontinued, canceled, locked, etc., according to the ORC-1 Order control code. The order is identified through ORC-2 Placer order number. The service itself is specified in the field OBR-4 Universal service ID. User defined codes are used to identify the specific services. The identification of the object of the service, e.g., phone number or card number, is done using the OBX-5 Observation value. The ORC-25 Order Status Modifier is used to refine the status of the universal service ID. For example, in the case of issuing chip cards, these fields would be valued as follows:

[width="100%",cols="9%,23%,19%,49%",]
|===
|ORC-1 |OBR-4 (in textual form) |ORC-16.1 Code |Description
|NW |chip card | |Issue a chip card the first time
|XO |chip card |defective |Change the previous order. Issue a new chip card for a defective one.
|XO |chip card |lost |Change the previous order. Issue a new chip card for a defective one.
|DC |Return chip card | |Cancel the chip card order
|DC |Return chip card |lost |Cancel the chip card order because lost.
|DC |Return chip card |defective |Cancel the chip card order because defective.
|===

Use of different universal service IDs allows for the ability to charge an additional fee.

• TQ1-7/8 +
The field TQ1 Quantity/timing describes time periods during which the requested service is valid. The components 4 and 5 denote the start and end date/time.

• ORC-5 +
In this field information on the status of the service can be transmitted. This field can be used in particular in response to a query message.

• ORC-25 +
This field allows for refining the status of the requested universal service, e.g., to change an order for a chip card in order to distribute a new card for a lost one.

• BLG-1,2,3 +
These fields indicate to the financial system that charges are to be invoiced for this service.

• FT1-17 +
In some cases it is necessary that the placer defines a special tariff the filler has to use for computing the final balance.

• FT1-11 +
In combination with the tariff the patient can prepay the ordered service. This may be helpful when the patient uses services provided by the hospital in order to use the service from the beginning. FT1-6 must be valued at "PY". +
If no amount is prepaid a limit can be established according to a special tariff. This depends on the setup of the filling system. In such a case the hospital grants a credit to the patient.

*Phone Number Assignment*

In case the patient requests a bedside phone and the number of this phone is assigned to that patient personally, a number of messages are transmitted. The objective is to connect a phone number to a patient and a room.

The update of the location master file depends on the setup of the private branch exchange system (PABX):

{empty}b) **Variable Numbering System +
**On admission the patient is assigned his or her personal call number, which he or she retains throughout that patient's stay, including if the patient is transferred. The patient can always be reached under the same call number. +
To understand the mechanism for M05 events it is important to know that two different sets of phone numbers exist: one is a pool to be used when querying for a phone number for a patient; the other one is used for temporary assign­ments when no patient is lying in the bed (i.e., the bed is free).

{empty}c) **Fixed Numbering System +
**On admission the system issues the patient with a telephone and/or TV authorization. This authorization key must be entered into the phone to activate it. +
No M05 messages are necessary if a fixed numbering system is used: Each telephone connection is assigned a permanent call number when the system is set up.

When the patient is admitted, an ADT^A01 message is sent to create a patient record in the phone number assigning application. Typically, the patient ID (PID-3), patient location (PV1-3), and visit number (PV1-19) are at least required. This message is acknowledged accordingly with an ACK. Then, the order for the phone number to the phone number assigning application is placed with the ORM^O01 message where the essential fields are ORC-1 = "NW", ORC-2 = <placer order number>, and OBR-4 = "Phone".

The ORR^O02 message is used to acknowledge the order and communicate the filler order number and order status. Then, when the phone number is available, an ORU^R01 message is used to communicate the phone number using OBX-5 for the phone number.

Any status changes to the order are communicated with the ORM^O01 message where ORC-1 = "SC", ORC-2 = <placer order number>, ORC-3 = <filler order number>, ORC-5 = <order status>, OBR-4 = "Phone", and OBX-5 = <Phone Number of Patient>. The status change is acknowledged with the ORR^O02 message.

Next, the location master files are updated. The phone number assigning application may send a MFN^M05 message to have the location master file reflect the phone number assignment as well. The fields on the message are valued as follows:

After processing the order: MFI-1 = "LOC", MFI-3 = "UPD", MFI-5 = <effective date/time>, MFE-1 = "MUP", LOC-1 = <patient location>, LOC-3 = "B" (bed), LOC-6 = <Phone Number of Patient>. This message is acknowledged using the MFK^M05 message.

*Transfer a patient (A02)*

If a patient keeps the same phone number during the whole visit the assigned phone number must be mapped to a different phone outlet whenever a patient is transferred to a new location. In that case, the ADT^A02 message is sent to the phone number assigning application. That application not only acknowledges the message, but also sends an ORM^O01 message with ORC-1 = "SC" and the other fields the same as described in the Phone Number Assignment section. Additionally, it sends a MFN^M05 message to change the location master file accordingly for the old location and another MFN^M05 to synchronize the phones for the new location.

*Leave of absence (A21/A22)*

When the patient leaves the hospital or the bed is vacated for a significant amount of time, the phone needs to be de-activated and re-activated appropriately. The same ORM^O01 and MFN^M05 messages are used as described above following the ADT^A21 and ADT^22 messages.

Patient makes calls or (de-)activates his phone.

The patient can use the phone whenever he wants to. This implies that his balance does not exceed the limit. Otherwise the phone is deactivated automatically. Furthermore the patient can activate or deactivate the phone by entering the authorization key for his own. In these scenarios the phone number assigning application sends and ORM^O01 message with ORC-1 = "OD" and the appropriate order status. The status update is necessary to provide a call switching system with the actual information.

*Discharge a patient (A03)*

When the patient is discharged, the ADT^A03 message is sent to indicate a discharge. The phone number assigning application sends an ORM^O01 message with a change of status to indicate completion of the order, as well as an MFN^M05 message to synchronize the location master file.

After discharging a patient his final charges must be billed. Using the query P04 returns the data in a display oriented format which can be used for printing. Alternatively a print request can be used. The billing system issues a QRY^P04 message where the fields are valued as follows: QRD-2 = "R" (record oriented format), QRD-3 = "I" (immediate response), QRD-8.1 = <Patient ID>, QRF-2 = <start date/time>, and QRF-3 = <end date/time>. The phone number assigning applications responds with a DSR^P04 message with the data in DSP-3.

*Note:* The original mode query, including QRD and QRF segments were retained for backward compatibility only as of v 2.4. The reader is therefore referred to chapter 5, section 5.4, for the current query/response message structure.

*Phone Call Queries (Z73)*

The new query modes using a query by parameter query with a virtual table response allows for obtaining call information from the phone system to be used for charging. The query can be for accumulated data or detailed data. Both requests use this conformance statement:

*Requesting a Chip card*

In case the hospital provides additional services that can be accessed through chip cards, this card has to be issued to the patient. At the end of the visit this chip card is returned. Distributing a chip card to a patient is a service which must be ordered from the chip card dispensing system, too. When discharging the patient the service (= order) is complete.

The messages are essentially the same as for issuing a phone number. The filler for the chip card order is a chip card dispensing application and instead of returning a phone number, it returns a chip card number. The following scenarios have slight variations.

*New Chip Card requested due to, e.g., loss*

When a card is lost, or a new chip card must be requested, an additional fee can be communicated by including the FT1 segment in the ORM^O01 message and valuing FT1-11 = <additional fee>.

*Request a new Chip card for a defective one*

Sometimes a chip card is defective. Then the patient needs a new one. This situation requires an order using the XO control code in the ORM^O01 message. The chip card dispensing system returns the new chip card number using the ORU^RO1. The ORC-16-Order Control Code Reason is used to clarify the request.

*Return a chip card*

When the patient returns the chip card, a discontinue message is send with ORC-1 = "DC". This message is acknowledged accordingly by the chip card dispensing system.

*Printing a form*

When form needs printing, the ORM^O01 could also be used. The OBR segment would contain the print form service and the OBX would contain the specific print form. A notification when completing the printing is feasible as well using the ORM^O01 with a status update associated to the appropriate placer/filler order number.

== 4.7 Diet Trigger Events & Message Definitions

A diet office needs to receive specific information, the most important being the diet order itself. Diet restrictions (often called diet codes) are the basic building blocks of a diet order. The diet order segments may be sent as part of the ORM and ORR message structure to support backwards compatibility, or may be sent as part of the following dedicated message structures.

The ODS segment is intended to cover the basic diet definition of one diet code. A diet can be ordered as a combination of one or more diet specifications, followed by any number of supplements and/or preferences. Many diets are common to all institutions, such as an ADA 1500 calorie diet, and may exist in a table. Each diet code is limited to a six-character abbreviation.

A dietary message never specifies more than one diet. However, a single diet order may be used to discontinue one diet and specify its replacement. In this instance, the dietary message will contain two ORCs. The first ORC will not contain an ODT. A tray specification order may follow the second ORC.

Often a complete diet order consists of a single diet code. The diet code defines which foods a patient may receive. In cases where a patient cannot make food selections, a diet code often causes service of a predefined set of foods. A patient must have at least one diet code to receive food.

Supplements provide a mechanism for giving any additional desired foods to a patient. Supplements are foods given to a patient regardless of their diet codes. These foods are part of the patient's diet without being restricted by any other part of the order. Therefore, supplement assignment needs to be a controlled and supervised process to ensure that a patient does not receive improper or potentially harmful foods.

Preferences consist of likes, dislikes, substitutions, and complementary foods. Preferences are diet orders, effectively from the patient, but transmitted from the ward. They are subject to change. A mechanism is included for defining patient preferences with this proposal. Preferences are independent of the diet order and do not change when the order changes. However, if a preference violates the conditions of the diet order, then that preference is not allowed.

There is additional information that the dietary service requires for proper operation, including tray delivery times, extra trays, and messages regarding tray delivery and handling.

A patient can have only one effective diet order at a time. A diet order consists of the diet codes, supplements, and preferences effective at a given time. These three specifications govern which foods a patient will receive. Diets generally do not have a stated ending time to ensure that the patient always receives food (unless an NPO order is received).

Diet codes govern foods in two ways. First, there are foods which are simply not allowed on a specified diet. Second, some diets imply a nutrient exchange pattern which controls the amounts of certain foods that a patient can receive. Some diet codes can combine to make a single diet order. An ADA 1500 and a 2 gram sodium (NA2GM) diet can coexist since they do not address the same exchanges. The patterns for these diets can combine without conflicting or overlapping. Certain kinds of diet codes cannot be combined, such as ADA 1500 and ADA 2000. It is impossible to feed a patient at two different calorie levels. These constraints are not defined in the table, but rather are implied by the semantics of the codes.

An order specifies the complete foods a patient can or should receive at a given meal. (Depending on the institution and diet order, a patient may or may not have a choice of foods. For example, a clear liquid diet often gives no choices since there are few clear liquid foods.) A modification to a diet, by adding a diet code or supplement, may have a drastic effect on foods the patient may eat. Due to this, any modification to the diet codes or supplements will be a new order. Therefore, one must send any information for diet codes or supplements from the previous order which is still applicable for the next order. For example, a patient has an ADA 1500 calorie diet and an evening snack of Skim Milk. If you wanted to add a 2 gram sodium restriction, you need to send both the ADA 1500 calorie and the 2 gram sodium diet codes along with the Skim Milk supplement. If you do not do this, the dietary application must presume the new order is merely for 2 grams of sodium. This method allows for a comprehensive audit trail of orders and prevents ambiguities in interpretation.

== 4.8 Diet Segments

=== 4.8.1 ODS ‑ dietary orders, supplements, and preferences segment

The ORC sequence items of interest to ODS are ORC-1-order control, ORC-2-placer order number, ORC-3-filler order number, TQ1-7/8-quantity/timing, ORC-9-date/time of transaction, ORC-10-entered by, and ORC-11-verified by. For ORC-1-order control, the values may be New (NW), Cancel (CA), Discontinue Order Request (DC), Change (XO), Hold Order Request (HD), and Release Previous Hold (RL). The HD and RL codes could stop service for a specified length of time. TQ1-quantity/timing should be used to specify whether an order is continuous or for one service period only. It is also useful for supplements which are part of a diet but only delivered, say, every day at night.

Example:

|1^QPM^^20010415|.

Definition: This field is the identifier of the ordered item for a patient; it is equivalent to OBR-4-universal service ID in function. Since ODS is a repeating segment, multiple entities get multiple segments. Refer to Table 0628 - Diet, Supplement, or Preference Code in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Example:

|^REG|, |023^^99FD6|, |^NOLACT|, |^TUBEFD|, and |011^HIPRO100^99FD1~123^LOFAT20^99FD1|

In the case where this segment requests a diet supplement, i.e., ODS-1-type = S, this attribute specifies a particular item or class of items. If institutional codes for patient food preferences (P) have been codified, they are also expressed as coded segments; otherwise, the information is passed as a text string in the fourth component of the ODS segment, described below.

==== 4.8.1.4 ODS-4 Text Instruction (ST) 00272

Definition: This field defines the specific instructions for dietary. These instructions may address specific patient needs, such as isolation. This field provides the ordering provider's dietary instructions as free text. It can represent the full dietary instruction or indicate supplemental information.

=== 4.8.2 ODT ‑ diet tray instructions segment

This segment addresses tray instructions. These are independent of diet codes, supplements, and preferences and therefore get separate order numbers.

Tray specifications are useful for early and late tray delivery in cases where a patient undergoes a procedure during normal feeding times. Tray specifications can also be used for guest trays, no trays, and messages. The value MSG means the ODT segment does not specify the type of tray but provides additional information about an existing tray. This information is found in ODT-3-text instruction.

== 4.10 Supply Trigger Events & Messages

The Requisition Detail segment (RQD) is used for ordering medical, surgical, and patient care supplies. It is assumed that these supplies are managed by a materials management application, which contains a master list of all items the hospital uses.

There are basically two types of supplies, commonly referred to as stock and non-stock.

Stock supplies are, as the name suggests, stocked in the hospital in designated areas, such as the warehouse, Central Supply, Nursing floors, or Operating Room. When requisitioning stock supplies, the requesting application need only specify the information in the RQD segment. It is assumed that this is enough information for the application receiving to identify the item. If the sending application is not aware whether the supply is stock, it may optionally send an RQ1 along with the RQD. Typically in that case, the item is requested with a free text description.

Non-stock supplies are not stocked anywhere in the hospital and must be ordered from an industry distributor or manufacturer. When the requesting application knows that it is requisitioning non-stock supplies, it may also send an RQ1 segment with the RQD if at least one field in RQ1 is known to the sending application. This may be necessary in order for the receiving application to properly determine where to get these supplies. This depends on the sophistication of the database of the receiving application, which may contain a history of requisitions from the sending application.

=== 4.10.1 OMS - stock requisition order message (event O05)

Stock requisition orders use the ORM where RQD is the detail segment for backward compatibility or can use the OMS and ORS messages described below.

==== 4.11.1.10 RQD-10 Date Needed (DT) 00284

Definition: This field contains the date this item is required.

*Note:* Although none of the fields are required, one of the three identifying codes—RQD-2-item code-internal, RQD-3-item code-external, or RQD-4-hospital item code—must be specified in order for the receiving application to process the request.

It is left to the vendors to determine which will be used as the common link between the two applications. HL7 recommends using the RQD-4-Hospital Item Code.

Hospital accounting requires an identifier to charge a particular cost center or patient for a requisitioned supply. If the supply is for a patient, then this identifier comes from the PID segment; otherwise, from RQD-7-Dept. Cost Center and RQD-8-Item Natural Account Code must be used. It is recommended that the "final" cost center responsible for providing the supply to the patient be included, even when the patient ID is provided.

Hospital accounting applications use RQD-7-Dept. Cost Center concatenated with RQD-8-Item Natural Account Code in order to post this transaction to the General Ledger. This concatenated value should correspond to a valid entry in the accounting applications "Chart of Accounts."

=== 4.11.2 RQ1 - Requisition Detail-1 Segment

RQ1 contains additional detail for each non-stock requisitioned item. This segment definition is paired with a preceding RQD segment.

==== 4.11.2.0 RQ1 field definitions

==== 4.11.2.1 RQ1-1 Anticipated Price (ST) 00285

Definition: This field contains the reference price for the requisition unit of measure that is known to the requisition application. It may or may not be the actual cost of acquiring the item from a supplier. It is also not the price charged to the patient.

==== 4.11.2.2 RQ1-2 Manufacturer Identifier (CWE) 00286

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains the unique code that identifies the manufacturer on the application receiving the requisition. This field is conditional because either RQ1-2-manufacturer ID and RQ1-3-manufacturer's catalog or RQ1-4-vendor ID and RQ1-5-vendor catalog must be valued.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70385[User-defined Table 0385 – Manufacturer identifier] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values, or relevant external code sets may be used (e.g., HIBCC Manufacturers Labeler ID Code (LIC), UPC, NDC).

==== 4.11.2.3 RQ1-3 Manufacturer's Catalog (ST) 00287

Definition: This field is the manufacturer's catalog number or code for this item. This field is conditional because either RQ1-2-manufacturer ID and RQ1-3-manufacturer's catalog or RQ1-4-vendor ID and RQ1-5-vendor catalog must be valued.

==== 4.11.2.4 RQ1-4 Vendor ID (CWE) 00288

Definition: This field is the unique code that identifies the vendor on the application receiving the requisition. This field is conditional because either RQ1-2-manufacturer ID and RQ1-3-manufacturer's catalog or RQ1-4-vendor ID and RQ1-5-vendor catalog must be valued. Refer to Table 0683 - Vendor ID in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Because of this, it is recommended that each non-stock item have RQ1-2-manufacturers ID and RQ1-3-manufacturer's catalog, or RQ1-4-vendor ID and RQ1-5-vendor catalog. It is also possible that the requisitioning application will not know the identifier, as listed in the Manufacturer's or Vendor's catalog. In this case, it is important to include the name portion of this coded element field.

==== 4.11.2.5 RQ1-5 Vendor Catalog (ST) 00289

Definition: This field is the vendor's catalog number, name, or code for this item. This field is conditional because either RQ1-2-manufacturer ID and RQ1-3-manufacturer's catalog or RQ1-4-vendor ID and RQ1-5-vendor catalog must be valued.

==== 4.11.2.6 RQ1-6 Taxable (ID) 00290

Definition: This field indicates whether this item is subject to tax.

In general, non-stock requisitioned items will be printed by the receiving application and then processed by a human. In other words, the human will use the information to call the vendor or manufacturer to get pricing and other related purchasing information before placing the order with an outside vendor. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70136[HL7 Table 0136 -Yes/No Indicator] as defined in Chapter 2C, Code Tables.

==== 4.11.2.7 RQ1-7 Substitute Allowed (ID) 00291

Definition: This field indicates whether the ancillary department may substitute an equivalent version of the item(s) ordered. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70136[HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/No Indicator] as defined in Chapter 2C, Code Tables.

== 4.13 Transfusion Service (Blood Bank) Trigger Events & Messages

=== 4.13.1 Usage notes for transfusion service messages

=== 4.13.2 OMB – Blood Product Order Message (Event O27) 

Blood product order messages present the need for additional information that is not included in standard HL7 order messages. Order messages must contain accompanying details regarding the blood product component, such as special processing requirements (e.g., irradiation and leukoreduction), and the amount of the blood product to be administered. Additionally, specific relevant clinical information can be included to allow the prospective review of the appropriateness of the blood product order.

Blood product orders use the OMB message with the BPO segment for the detail segment and the acknowledgment message, ORB as described below.

OMB use notes

The NTE segment(s) can be included in the OMB message in four places; in each place the NTE refers to the segment that it follows. In particular, the NTEs following the MSH refer only to the message header; the NTEs following the blood product order segment apply to the service defined by that ORC and blood product order segment.

The PID segment is required if and only if new orders are being entered and they are related to a particular patient. For non-patient-related orders the PID segment is never included.

The optional PV1 segment is present mainly to permit transmission of patient visit information such as current location with an order.

=== 4.13.4 BPS – Blood Product Dispense Status Message (Event O29) 

In the pre-transfusion processing of blood products, it is necessary for the transfusion service and the placer system to communicate information that is not included in the current HL7 order/observation model. Examples of pre-transfusion processing include performing a crossmatch test to ensure compatibility with the patient, or irradiation of the blood product due to a special transfusion requirement for the patient. The blood product dispense status messages need to contain additional information regarding the blood products requested, such as the Donation ID, product code, blood type, expiration date/time and current status of the blood product.

In the processing of commercial blood products, such as Rh Immune Globulin, Factor Concentrate, or Albumin Products, the status messages need to contain additional information, such as the lot number and manufacturer, expiration date and status of the commercial product.

Blood product dispense status messages use the BPS and BRP messages as described below.

== 4.14 Transfusion Service (Blood Bank) Segments

=== 4.14.1 BPO – Blood Product Order Segment

Blood product order messages require additional information that is not available in other standard HL7 order messages. Blood product order messages need to contain accompanying details regarding the blood product component, such as special processing requirements (e.g., irradiation and leukoreduction) and the amount of the blood product to be administered.

The following table presents various use cases surrounding blood product orders.

=== 4.14.2 BPX – Blood Product Dispense Status Segment

In the processing of blood products, it is necessary for the transfusion service and the placer system to communicate information. The status messages need to contain additional information regarding the blood products requested, such as the unique donation ID, product code, blood type, expiration date/time of the blood product, and current status of the product. This segment is similar to an OBX segment, but contains additional attributes.

==== 4.14.2.0 BPX field definitions

The BP prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains to any type of blood product. A blood product is defined as any type of blood component or commercially prepared blood product that is prepared and dispensed from the transfusion service.

The BC prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains only to blood components. A blood component is defined as the whole or any part of a blood donation. For example, from one whole blood donation, the unit of whole blood can be fractionated into red blood cells, plasma and platelets with each component contained in separate bags. These types of blood products are assigned a unique donation identification number as well as a product code that indicates the type of component contained in the bag.

The CP prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains only to Commercial Products. A commercial product is defined as a commercially manufactured product, such as blood derivatives ( Rh Immune Globulin, Factor VIII Concentrate or Blood Recipient Sets or Filters). These types of products are tracked by manufacturer and lot number and are not necessarily assigned a unique donation number.

For example, the first status change of a product that may trigger a Blood Product Dispense Status Message occurs when it first becomes linked to a patient and is ready to dispense. The placer system may use the Blood Product Dispense Status Message to request the transfusion service to dispense the product. When the blood product is delivered or issued to a patient, the status of the blood product would be changed to indicate that it has now been "dispensed." Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70510[HL7 Table 0510 - Blood Product Dispense Status] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries.

==== 4.14.2.3 BPX-3 BP Status (ID) 01716

Definition: The most commonly used message status values in a BPX will be preliminary and final. A status is considered preliminary until a blood product has reached a final disposition for the patient. For example, when the product is first cross-matched and a status message is sent, it would be considered preliminary. When the product is dispensed to the patient, that status would also be considered preliminary. However, once the product is transfused, the status would be considered final. The status of a blood product (BPX-2) can continue to change and the previous status should be overwritten until it reaches a final status (BPX-3). Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70511[HL7 Table 0511 - BP Observation Status Codes Interpretation] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries.

==== 4.14.2.4 BPX-4 BP Date/Time of Status (DTM) 01717

Definition: This field indicates the date and time that the status of the blood component was changed. For example, if the blood component had a status, of "RD" (Ready to Dispense), the date and time in this field would indicate the date and time that component was made ready to dispense by the filler system.

==== 4.14.2.5 BPX-5 BC Donation ID (EI) 01718

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: The Donation ID is the unique identification number assigned to a blood donation. The Donation ID depends upon the bar code labeling system used for the component. There are currently two blood component labeling standards: _ABC CODABAR_ and _ISBT 128_. The preferred labeling system is _ISBT 128_. If using _ISBT 128,_ the Donation ID is an internationally unique identifier consisting of the following 13 characters:

Country Code & Collection Facility - 5 characters

Donation Year - 2 characters

Serial Number - 6 characters

This field is required for blood components and is not applicable for commercial product messages.

==== 4.14.3.0 BTX field definitions

The BP prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains to any type of blood product. A blood product is defined as any type of blood component or commercially prepared blood product that is prepared and dispensed from the transfusion service.

The BC prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains only to blood components. A blood component is defined as any part or all of a whole blood donation. For example, from one whole blood donation, the unit of whole blood can be fractionated into red blood cells, plasma and platelets with each component contained in separate bags. These types of blood products are always assigned a unique donation identification number as well as a product code that indicates the type of component contained in the bag.

The CP prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains only to Commercial Products. A commercial product is defined as a commercially manufactured product, such as blood derivatives (Rh Immune Globulin, Factor VIII Concentrate or Blood Recipient Sets or Filters). These types of products are tracked by manufacturer and lot number and are not necessarily assigned a unique donation number.

==== 4.14.3.1 BTX-1 Set ID – BTX (SI) 01735

Definition: This field contains the sequence number for the BTX segment under the related BPO segment. For the first product transfusion/disposition transmitted, the sequence number shall be 1; for the second product transfusion/disposition, it shall be 2; and so on.

==== 4.14.3.2 BTX-2 BC Donation ID (EI) 01736

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: The donation ID is the unique identification number assigned to a blood donation. The Donation ID depends upon the bar code labeling system used for the component. There are currently two blood component labeling standards: _ABC CODABAR_ and _ISBT 128_. The preferred labeling system is _ISBT 128_. If using _ISBT 128,_ the Donation ID is an internationally unique identifier consisting of the following 13 characters:

Country Code & Collection Facility - 5 characters

Donation Year - 2 characters

Serial Number - 6 characters

This is required for blood components and is not applicable for commercial product messages.

Definition: This field indicates the current status of the specified blood product as indicated by the placer. For example, the placer may return the blood product to the transfusion service unused because an IV could not be started. The blood component may have been entered, but the line was clogged and could not be used, in which case the component must be wasted. A final status would indicate that the product has actually been "transfused." Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70513[HL7 Table 0513 - Blood Product Transfusion/Disposition Status] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

==== 4.14.3.12 BTX-12 BP Message Status (ID) 01746

Definition: The most commonly used message status values in a BTX will be preliminary and final. A status is considered preliminary until a blood product has reached a final disposition for the patient. For example, when the product is first cross-matched and a status message is sent, it would be considered preliminary. When the product is dispensed to the patient, that status would also be considered preliminary. However, once the product is transfused, the status would be considered final. The status of a blood product (BTX-11) can continue to change and the previous result should be overwritten until it reaches a final status (BTX-12). Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70511[HL7 Table 0511 – BP Observation Status Codes Interpretation] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries.

==== 4.14.3.13 BTX-13 BP Date/Time of Status (DTM) 01747

Definition: This field indicates the date and time that the status of the blood component was changed. For example, if the blood component had a status of "TX" (Transfused), the date and time in this field would indicate the date and time the component was transfused by the placer system.

== 4.16 Donation Service (Blood Bank) Trigger Events and Messages

=== 4.16.1 Usage Notes for Donation Service (Blood Bank)

The Donation Service (BLOOD BANK) uses a different methodology than the similar Transfusion Service (BLOOD BANK) already present in this standard. Each of the segments defined for the Transfusion Service groups together all the 'transfusion' information in one segment, each. The Donation Service was developed breaking out the blood product 'donated' from the donation event itself. This is a more sustainable and interoperable approach. Future changes to the Transfusion Service should uptake this style.

=== 4.16.2 Activity Diagram

The donation service messages facilitate communications between typical system components in a blood bank donation service facility. Frequently different components of blood banking systems (e.g. registration, questionnaire) are bundled together in one system produced by one vendor. However since there is no standard for that bundling, in any particular implementation any of the named system components can be implemented on another system and therefore communications to that component is necessary. The typical components are illustrated in the graphic below.

Additionally, the graphic also depicts a flow of information through those systems during a donation process.

image:extracted-media/media/image10.jpeg[Blood Bank Donation Systems Diagram,width=618,height=516]

=== 4.1.1 

=== 4.16.3 Actors

As mentioned previously, many of the existing systems used in the collection process conduct all these actions in a single bundled system. Extension of the systems on this page is presented in this format because there is no standard for that bundling, in any particular implementation any of the named system components can be implemented on another system and therefore communications to that component is necessary.

==== 4.16.3.0 Ordering Provider

For Directed and Autologous Donations, this is the Healthcare Provider requesting a blood donation.

==== 4.16.3.1 Registration System

All donors are registered in this system.

==== 4.16.3.2 Donor book of record System

This is the source-of-truth for every donor, whether evaluated and deferred, rejected, or not deferred.

==== 4.16.3.3 Mini-physical System

The mini-physical examination conducted on all potential donors is documented using this system.

==== 4.16.3.4 Questionnaire System

Each potential donor must fill out a questionnaire which asks about previous medical history and risk factors using this documentation system.

==== 4.16.3.5 Donation System

The phlebotomists and other healthcare professionals use this system to document the blood donation procedure.

==== 4.16.3.6 Device Interfaces

Interface to devices used during the mini-physical, donation, and shipping systems.

==== 4.16.3.7 Provider Master

This system keeps the master list of providers.

==== 4.16.3.8 Shipping System

This system is used to document the shipping manifest from information received from the actual donations.

=== 4.18.1 Figure 4-8 Associations between Order Control Codes and Trigger Events

Figure 4-8 defines the explicit relationships that exist between Order Control Codes and Trigger Events. A value of "Y" at the intersection of an Order Control Code and a Trigger Event indicates that is a valid combination that can be used in a message. A value of "N" indicates that combination is not valid in any message. No value at an intersection indicates that no business case has been brought forward for to justify or exclude that combination.
