==== 11.2.1.1 Patient referral

There are clear distinctions between a referral and an order. An order is almost always an intra-enterprise transaction and represents a request from a patient's active provider to supporting providers for clearly defined services and/or results. While the supporting provider may exercise great discretion in the performance of an order, overall responsibility for the patient's plan of treatment remains with the ordering provider. As such, the ordering provider retains significant control authority for the order and can, after the fact, cause the order to be canceled, reinstated, etc. Additionally, detailed results produced by the supporting provider are always reported back to the ordering provider, who remains ultimately responsible for evaluating their value and relevance. A referral, on the other hand, can be either an intra- or an inter-enterprise transaction and represents not only a request for additional provider support but also a transfer of a portion or all of the responsibility for the patient's plan of treatment. Once the referral is made, the referring provider, during the transfer period, retains almost no control of any resulting actions. The referred-to provider becomes responsible for placing any additional orders and for evaluating the value and relevance of any results, which may or may not be automatically passed back to the referring provider. A referred-to provider may, in turn, also become a referring provider.

A referral message is used to support transactions related to the referral of a patient from one healthcare provider to another. This kind of message will be particularly useful from the perspective of a primary care provider referring a patient to a specialist. However, the application of the message should not be limited to this model. For example, a referral may be as simple as a physician sending a patient to another physician for a consultation or it may be as complex as a primary care provider sending a patient to a specialist for specific medical procedures to be performed and attaching the payor authorizations for those requested procedures as well as the relevant clinical information on the patient's case.

In a community model, stringent security requirements will need to be met when dealing with the release of clinical information. This message set facilitates the proper qualification of requests because the message packet will contain all the data required by any application in the community, including the necessary patient demographic information and the proper identification of the party requesting the information.
