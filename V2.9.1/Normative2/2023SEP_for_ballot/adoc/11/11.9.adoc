== 11.9 EXAMPLES

The following examples will demonstrate the proposed way in which the RQI, RQA and REF messages can be used with the I01 (request for insurance information), I08 (request for treatment authorization information), I15 (request patient referral status) and I06 (request/receipt of clinical data listing) event codes. The events are presented in the order in which they would occur in a typical patient encounter. The first event to occur when the patient visits the medical practice is the verification of eligibility/coverage information. Next, the patient will be diagnosed and may be referred to a specialist for further treatment. This procedure may require a request for pre-authorization from the payor, which will be forwarded to the referral provider. Once the referral provider begins treatment, messages regarding the status or outcome of the treatment will be sent to the referring provider. Queries may also be sent to the specialist and reference laboratories.
