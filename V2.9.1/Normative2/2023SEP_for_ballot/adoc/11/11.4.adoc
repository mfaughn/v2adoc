== 11.4 PATIENT TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS

This functional definition applies to a request for treatment authorization. Although this message also pertains to the payor, it differs greatly from that of an insurance information request. This message is used to request an authorization for specific procedures. Just as patient identification was important in an insurance information request, the focus of this functional area is provider identification, requested treatments/procedures and, in many cases, clinical information on a patient needed to fulfill review or certification requirements.
