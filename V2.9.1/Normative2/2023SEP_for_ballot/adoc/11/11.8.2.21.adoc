Definition: The authorization encounter type provides a means of specifying the environment for the performance of the authorized services. For example, it is common for a procedure to be authorized only for an outpatient environment. If something causes the procedure to be performed in an inpatient environment, a new authorization would be needed. Refer to Table 0574 - Encounter Type in Chapter 2C for valid values.
