=== 14.4.2 NSC – Application Status Change Segment

The NSC segment is used to inform (NMR query response) or announce (NMD unsolicited update) the start‑up, shut‑down, and/or migration (to a different CPU or file‑server/file‑system) of a particular application.

*Usage Notes:* Fields 2-9. These are not applicable ("n/a") when the type of change being requested or reported is start-up or shut-down. If the change is of type "M", at least one of fields 2-5 must be different from its corresponding field in range 6-9.

Fields 4-5, 8-9. See definitions for the MSH, message header segment, in Chapter 2, "Control Section," for fields 3-4, for system and facility. "Application" is available for interfacing with lower level protocols. "Facility" is entirely site-defined.

Fields 2-3, 6-7: entirely site-defined.
