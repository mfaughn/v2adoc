=== 5.6.4 Batch message as a query response

The HL7 query also can be used to query for a batch in the following manner:

{empty}a) Use the value B of _RCP-3-Response modality_ to specify a batch response.

*Note:* If using old style query mode, the value BB or BL of _QRD-5-Deferred response type_ may be used to specify a batch response. The query will be acknowledged with a general acknowledgment as in the Deferred Access example above

{empty}b) In addition, insert into the batch file the query defining and RCP segments as follows:

[width="100%",cols="24%,76%",]
|===
|[FHS] |(file header segment)
|\{ |
|[BHS] |(batch header segment)
|QPD |Query defining segment Note: if using old style query mode, the QRD and QRF segments may be used.
|[RCP] |
|\{ |
|MSH |(one or more HL7 messages)
|.... |
|.... |
|.... |
|} |
|[BTS] |(batch trailer segment)
|} |
|[FTS] |(file trailer segment)
|===

{empty}c) The acknowledgment of a batch is described in Chapter 2.

{empty}d) The Query Profile should stipulate if the batch modality is supported.
