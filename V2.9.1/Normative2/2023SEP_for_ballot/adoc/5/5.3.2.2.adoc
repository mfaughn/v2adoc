*Query Statement ID*: The unique identifier applying to this Query Profile. This value is transmitted as the first component of _QPD-1-Message query name_.

*Query Trigger (= MSH-9)*: The exact value that the Client will transmit in the _MSH-9-Message type_ field of the query message.

*Query Mode*: Whether the query may be sent in *Real time* (including Bolus) or in *Batch*; see section _5.5.6.3_, "_Interactive continuation of response messages_." The value *Both* indicates that both real-time/bolus and batch modes are acceptable.

*Response Trigger (= MSH-9)*: The exact value that the Server will transmit in the _MSH-9-Message type_ field of the response message.

*Query Characteristics*: Particular features of this query. This is free text intended to help the query implementor in selecting among queries.

*Purpose*: The end result that this query is intended to accomplish. Free text.

*Response Characteristics*: Particular features of this response. This is free text intended to help the query implementor in selecting among queries.
