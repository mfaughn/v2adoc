|ColName (Query ID=Z87) |Comp. Name |DT |Description
|PatientList | |CX |The combination of values for _PatientList.ID, and PatientList.AssigningAuthority,_ are intended to identify a unique entry on the PATIENT_MASTER table. The _PatientList.IdentifierTypeCode_ is useful for further filtering or to supply uniqueness in the event that the assigning authority may have more than one coding system. (The PATIENT_MASTER table contains a constraint that prevents multiple patients from being identified by the same combination of field values.) This PATIENT_MASTER entry will be searched against on the PHARMACY_DISPENSE_TRANSACTION table to retrieve the rows fulfilling the query conditions.
