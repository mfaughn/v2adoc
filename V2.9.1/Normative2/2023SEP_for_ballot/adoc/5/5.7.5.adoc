=== 5.7.5 Canceling a subscription

Canceling a subscription is analogous to canceling a query. See sections 5.4.6 and 0.

The template would be as follows:

MSH|^~\&|||||||QSX^Jnn^QSX_J01|

QID...

To cancel the subscription cited in the previous section, CommunityWest would send a cancel message with event code J99:

MSH|^~\&|CPR|COMWEST|PS^LAB||||QSX^J99^QSX_J01|

QID|Q0044|Q99^ORU_Subscription^HL70003|
