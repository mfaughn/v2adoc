===== 5.2.5.1.3 Expression as a complex expression

In contrast, the Complex Expression variant allows flexible input specifications. This allows more choices for the Client system, but can require more complex processing capability on the part of the Server System.

If the above Simple Parameter variant were to be stated as a Complex Expression, it might look like this.

Note the explicit statement of the input field name in _QPD-3-user parameters_. Also, note that this query might be used to specify and request other fields, depending upon the specification of what is permitted by the server system's Query Profile.

|Query Modalities |
|Simple Parameter Variant |The Server specifies parameters and the Client passes specific values to the parameters when the query is invoked.
|Complex Expression Variant |The Server offers variables which can be used by the Client who passes a constraining expression (subject to any limitations specified by the Query Profile) over those variables when invoking the query.
|===

Using the new modalities shown in the table, the variety and number of queries is almost unlimited. There is no implication that a specific Server must support all of these potential generalized queries to comply with the Standard. Rather, these transactions provide a format, or a set of tools, to support queries to the extent desired by the institution. The resources available and local policies will influence the types of queries that are implemented.
