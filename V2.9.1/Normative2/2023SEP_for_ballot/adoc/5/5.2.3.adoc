=== 5.2.3 Query development methodology

Typically, an individual HL7 conformant query would evolve as follows:

An institution, or data owner, decides that it would like to make information available via a query. It decides precisely what data will be made available and how it will be offered. Knowing its own data, the data owner will define its query to return one of three representations of the data:

____
{empty}1) As traditional HL7 segments. (See section _5.2.4.1_, "_Segment pattern response_.")

{empty}2) As rows and columns of data from a precisely defined Virtual Table. (See section _5.2.4.2_, "_Tabular response_.")

{empty}3) As rows of human readable text ready to output to a screen or printer. (See section _5.2.4.3_, "_Display response_.")
____

Next, the data owner specifies exactly which input variables the Client can use to control the data that the Server agrees to return.

The complete specification of what data are available, how the data will be returned, and what variables can be valued or constrained in a Query is called the Query Profile.

The Query Profile concept is critical to the proper usage of the query/response pair. In the absence of a Query Profile, the Client would be unaware of the existence of the query, let alone how to use it or what to expect from it**_._** The data owner advertises the existence of, and support for, a query by publishing a *_Query Profile_*.

The Query Profile has the following broad structure:

|Input Specification and Commentary

*Query Profile*: A declaration which sets forth the name of the query supported by the Server, the logical structure of the information that can be queried, and the logical structure of what can be returned.

Section 0, "_Note that the_ Vaccination Query related messages have been removed as these were deprecated and withdrawn as of v 2.8.

Acknowledgment Choreography

As of Version 2.9 Infrastructure and Messaging requires that Acknowledgment Choreography be explicitly specified in MSH-15 and MSH-16. Because of the nature of the Query and Response Messaging pattern, the Response message is always an Application Acknowledgment. To specify this, the value in MSH-16 SHALL always be “AL” to indicate that there will always be an Application Acknowledgment to the Query Message. See Chapter 2 for more details on this subject.

QUERY/RESPONSE PROFILE," will explain the Query Profile in detail.

The next section elaborates on the three styles of response data (segment pattern, tabular, and display) that a data owner may use to represent its data.

The introduction of the Query Profile concept is not intended to imply system certification. It is intended to promote well-specified queries. As in previous versions, support for queries is not required for HL7 conformance.
