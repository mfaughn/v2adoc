=== 5.6.1 Immediate vs. deferred response

Responses to queries can be either immediate or deferred. In the immediate mode, the responding process gives the response immediately or in a short period during which the requesting process will wait for the response. In the deferred mode, the response is returned asynchronously, as a separate message pair. Also, a time interval for the deferred transaction may be specified.

In the case of immediate mode query, the Server does NOT send a General Acknowledgement (ACK). The acknowledgement of the query is contained within the response message. In the case of deferred mode, the query is acknowledged immediately by an ACK. The Server sends the deferred response at the appropriate time. The Client acknowledges the response with an ACK. In short, the deferred query transaction consists of 2 "round trips."

If an immediate mode query message is malformed, a negative ACK is immediately sent.

Use cases for Deferred Response include:

____
{empty}1) evaluate the query conditions at a certain point in time and then return the response. For example, "At 9 AM tomorrow, evaluate query and return response";

{empty}2) produce a large report to be communicated to the Server at an off-peak hour. For example, a response which contains all admissions records for the month to be sent at 4:00 a.m., or a reference lab results listing to be sent at noon. A deferred response can benefit both Server and Client in such cases, especially where the generation, communication, and receipt of segments can all be done at times of otherwise low-volume processing.
____

If the Query Profile indicates that the Server will support both immediate and deferred responses, then the Client may indicate the desired value of this property by sending it in the _RCP-1 Response priority_ field. If the Server supports only one response type, then the value specified by the Client SHALL agree.

The following examples demonstrate how the same query could be invoked in either immediate or deferred mode.
