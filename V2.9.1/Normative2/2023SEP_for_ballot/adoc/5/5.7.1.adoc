=== 5.7.1 Introduction

"Publish and subscribe" refers to the ability of one system, the "Publisher", to offer a data stream that can be sent to recipient systems upon subscription. In one sense, the entire HL7 unsolicited update paradigm, in which the sender sends out a stream of messages to recipients, is a kind of publish and subscribe mechanism. Subscriptions to unsolicited updates are established at interface set-up time when analysts on both sides agree to start sending a stream of data.

This section describes a mechanism by which the Publisher defines a stream of data, but also agrees to selectively subset the message stream based on query-like data constraints. In the normal case, the right of the Subscriber to subscribe is decided at interface setup time. At runtime, the Subscriber controls the data rules under which it sends messages.

Runtime subscription has existed in earlier versions of HL7, but little attention has been drawn to it. Original mode queries could define an open ended time interval in _QRF-9-When quantity/timing qualifier_. The unexplained semantics of this field had been interpreted to mean: If the QRF-9 specified an end time in the future, then the source system would keep sending results using the query continuation protocol.

This section elaborates on such a mechanism, and more cleanly ties the selective filtering into the whole query facility.
