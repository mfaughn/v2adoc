==== 5.3.2.13 Output specification for tabular response

The output specification for the tabular response consists of the Virtual Table description, i.e., the columns and rows. It has the same columns as the input specification, but the rows reflect all of the available rows in the table, not just those that can be filtered upon input.

|===

The usage of the columns in this table is as described in section _5.3.2.8_, "_QBE input parameter specification_." Note that the Key/Search and Match Op fields are only meaningful when a virtual table is used in the input specification (QSC variant).

When the QSC variant is in use, the "Input/Output Specification and Commentary" virtual table is used for selection of output fields. No separate table is specified for output.
