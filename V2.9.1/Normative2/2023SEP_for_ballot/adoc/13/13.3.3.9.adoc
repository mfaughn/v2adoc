Definition: This field identifies the type of the carrier (see section _13.1.3_, "_Glossary_"). Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70378[_User-defined Table 0378 – Carrier Type_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. Because the geometry can be different, the carrier type should, if possible, express the number of positions in the carrier.

The definition assumes hierarchical nesting using the following phrases: container is located in a carrier; carrier is located in a tray.
