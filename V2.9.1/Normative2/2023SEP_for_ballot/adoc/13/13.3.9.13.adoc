Definition: This field is the units that have a data type of CWE. The default coding system for the units codes consists of the ISO+ abbreviation for a single case unit (ISO 2955â€‘83) plus extensions, that do not collide with ISO abbreviations (see Chapter 7, section 7.4.2.6). We designate this coding system as ISO+. Both the ISO unit's abbreviations and the extensions are defined in Chapter 7, section 7.4.2.6.2 and listed in Figure 7-9. The ISO+ abbreviations are the codes for the default coding system. Consequently, when ISO+ units are being used, only ISO+ abbreviations need be sent, and the contents of the units field will be backward compatible to HL7 Version 2.1. For more information on this field see reference Chapter 7, section 7.4.2.6.

These units apply to fields "Endogenous content of pre-dilution diluent" and "Equipment dynamic range".

Refer to Table 0788 - Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.
