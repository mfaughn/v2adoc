Definition: This field identifies the type of the tray (see section _13.1.3_, "_Glossary_"). Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70379[_User-defined Table 0379 â€“ Tray Type_] in chapter 2C for suggested values. Because the geometry can be different, the tray type should if possible express the number of positions in the tray.

The definition assumes hierarchical nesting using the following phrases: container is located in a carrier, carrier is located in a tray.
