Definition: This field is the unit identifier that is being used to describe the volume of the container. If the units are ISO+ units, they should be recorded as single case abbreviations. The default unit is milliliters (ml), which should be assumed if no units are reported. Refer to Table 0777 - Volume Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.
