Definition: This field is the duration of time that the calibration/usability of the substance is stable. The duration is used to calculate the date/time when this calibration is no longer valid by adding this "On board stability time" (INV-19) to the "First used date / time" (INV-13).

The 1^st^ component defines the time quantity and the 2^nd^ component the time units (see file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70255[_HL7 Table 0255 â€“ Duration Categories_]). Recommended accuracy is "minutes", "hours" and "days".
