Definition: The type code of an equipment state indicator. Refer to _HL7 Table 0942 – Equipment State Indicator Type Code_ in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

Due to its dynamic nature, an equipment state indicator is considered to be a [non-material] inventory item. Its value usually can be derived from the material inventory — in that way, a state indicator differs from static configuration parameters and master data stored on the equipment.

This field is conditional. It is optional when INV‑3 “Substance Type” is not populated and prohibited otherwise.
