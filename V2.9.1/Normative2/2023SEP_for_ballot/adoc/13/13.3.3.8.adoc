Definition: This field identifies the status of the unique container in which the specimen resides at the time that the transaction was initiated. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70370[_HL7 Table 0370 - Container Status_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values. The equipment specific container status should be sent as _<alternate identifier>_ as needed.

The container states are relevant for the exchange of information among devices (within the LAS). Not all of them are relevant for information transfer between the LAS and the LIS.
