==== 13.1.3.24 Directions of the specimen, Transportation system, Instrument or Specimen processing and handling device interfaces:

The orthogonal axes.

*Note:* a) These axes are demonstrated in Figure 13-1.

X–direction, _n -_ The direction that a specimen travels along a transportation system.

*Note*: b) Specimens would move along the X dimension as, for example, in transportation from station to station in a laboratory (see Figure 13-2.)

Figure 13-2. X Direction

Y–direction, _n -_ The horizontal direction perpendicular to specimen travel along a transportation system;

*Note:* c) Specimens could move in the Y dimension away from a transport system to be placed onto an instrument for analysis (see Figure 13-3). The sample probe would move in the Y dimension as it moves out from the instrument or specimen processing and handling device to a position directly over the specimen container.

Z–direction, _n_ - The vertical dimension;

*Notes:* d) Specimens could be lifted in the Z dimension off a transport system for transfer between locations;

{empty}e) The center line of a container should be controlled, so it is in the Z dimension; a specimen centering device would be referenced to the Z dimension; a sample probe would follow the Z dimension as it moves downward into a specimen container to aspirate serum, blood, etc. for analysis (see Figure 13-4);

{empty}f) Rotation about the Z dimension may be used to locate and read the bar-code label on a specimen container or to assess the quality of a specimen in terms of turbidity, hemolysis, icterus, etc.
