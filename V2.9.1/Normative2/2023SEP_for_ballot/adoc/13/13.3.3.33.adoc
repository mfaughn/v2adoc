Definition: This field is the unit's identifier that is being used to describe the Hemolysis Index of the specimen. It is recommended to use g/L. (The transmission of the index values is added here instead of the original use of the OBX segments, because the frequency of the transfer of the specimen details justifies use of more efficient mechanism.) Refer to Table 0779 - Hemolysis Index Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

If this field is null, the recommended value is assumed.
