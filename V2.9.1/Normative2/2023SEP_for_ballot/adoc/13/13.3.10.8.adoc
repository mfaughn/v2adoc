Definition: This field identifies the repeat status for the analyte/result (e.g., original, rerun, repeat, reflex). Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70389[_HL7 Table 0389 – Analyte Repeat Status_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

For purpose of this chapter we assume the following:

• Repeated test without dilution — performed usually to confirm correctness of results (e.g., in case of results flagged as "Panic" or mechanical failures).

• Repeated test with dilution — performed usually in the case the original result exceeded the measurement range (technical limits).

• Reflex test — this test is performed as the consequence of rules triggered based on other test result(s).
