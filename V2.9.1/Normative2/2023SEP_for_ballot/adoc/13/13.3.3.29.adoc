==== 13.3.3.29 SAC-29 Dilution Factor (SN) 01356

Components: <Comparator (ST)> ^ <Num1 (NM)> ^ <Separator/Suffix (ST)> ^ <Num2 (NM)>

Definition: This field identifies the factor of dilution already performed on the specimen. The equipment entity that changes the dilution is responsible for sending this information to other equipment. If the endogenous content of the test (analyte) in the diluent is required for the calculation of the test (analyte) concentration, then the test (analyte) specific values should be exchanged between the systems via Master Files or other means.

Examples of use:

|^1^:^5| - means dilution 1 to 5, i.e., 1 part sample, 4 parts diluent

|^1^+| - sample is diluted, but the factor is unknown

|^1^:^1| - not diluted sample

|| - dilution not changed
