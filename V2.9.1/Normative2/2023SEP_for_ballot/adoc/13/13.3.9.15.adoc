Definition: This field identifies the test the Test Criticality. The values in this field are used for decisions, which tests should be performed, in case of, e.g., insufficient specimen volume. +
The data type is CWE because its meaning is a coded value. However, in order to make the processing decisions easy the content can be a sequential number of the test sorted according to the criticality assigned by the lab. The lower numbers are more critical than higher numbers.
