Definition: This field transfers the state of the interaction. If the interaction is performed as the result of a previous command, then the interaction state should be one of the Command Responses (Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70387[_User-defined Table 0387 â€“ Command Response_]). If the interaction is not performed as a result of a command (e.g., periodically time triggered automatic maintenance) then this state is interaction specific, and should refer to either the LECIS state transitions for interactions or a user or equipment specific table.
