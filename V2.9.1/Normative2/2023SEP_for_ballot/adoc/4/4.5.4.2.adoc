Definition: This field specifies the numeric quantity of the service that should be provided at each service interval. For example, if two blood cultures are to be obtained every 4 hours, the quantity would be '2', or if three units of blood are to be typed and cross-matched, the quantity would be '3'. The default value for this field is '1'.

If multiple identical services are to be requested, it is strongly recommended that multiple service requests be placed, giving each service request its own unique placer/filler number.
