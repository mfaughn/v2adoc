==== 4.5.5.9 TQ2-9 Cyclic Group Maximum Number of Repeats (NM) 01656

Definition: The maximum number of repeats for a cyclic group.

The total number of repeats is constrained by the end date/time of the last repeat or the end date/time of the parent, whichever is first. For example, if the total number or repeats is valued at 10 and the group has already repeated 5 times, the current order will not be repeated again if either the current order, or the prior order in the cycle, has reached its end date/time.

This field is meaningful only when TQ2-2 Sequence/Results Flag is valued with 'C'. However, even in this case this field is optional.
