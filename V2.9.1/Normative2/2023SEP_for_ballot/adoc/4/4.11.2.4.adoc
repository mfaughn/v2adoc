Definition: This field is the unique code that identifies the vendor on the application receiving the requisition. This field is conditional because either RQ1-2-manufacturer ID and RQ1-3-manufacturer's catalog or RQ1-4-vendor ID and RQ1-5-vendor catalog must be valued. Refer to Table 0683 - Vendor ID in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Because of this, it is recommended that each non-stock item have RQ1-2-manufacturers ID and RQ1-3-manufacturer's catalog, or RQ1-4-vendor ID and RQ1-5-vendor catalog. It is also possible that the requisitioning application will not know the identifier, as listed in the Manufacturer's or Vendor's catalog. In this case, it is important to include the name portion of this coded element field.
