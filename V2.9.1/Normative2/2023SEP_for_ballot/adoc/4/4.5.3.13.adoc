Definition: This field contains additional clinical information about the patient or specimen. This field is used to report the supporting and/or suspected diagnosis and clinical findings on requests for interpreted diagnostic studies where a simple text string or code is sufficient. This field could use all appropriate code sets including SNOMED to message Relevant Clinical Information. If more information is needed, such as date/time of the observation, who observed it, abnormal ranges, etc., or must be provided in further structured format, e.g., structured numeric with units of measure encoded, the Observation/Result group following the OBR should be used. Examples include reporting the amount of inspired carbon dioxide for blood gasses, the point in the menstrual cycle for cervical pap tests, and other conditions that influence test interpretations.
