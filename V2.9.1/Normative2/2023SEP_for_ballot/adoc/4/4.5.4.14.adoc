Definition: This field contains the total number of occurrences of a service that should result from this service request. If both the end date/time (TQ1-8) and the total occurrences are valued and the occurrences would extend beyond the end date/time, then the end date/time takes precedence. Otherwise the number of occurrences takes precedence.
