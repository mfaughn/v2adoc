Definition: This field indicates that a second TQ1 segment is to follow. Refer To link:#HL70472[HL7 Table 0472 â€“ TQ Conjunction ID] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for allowed values.

For continuous or periodic services, the point at which the service is actually stopped is determined by the field TQ1-8 end date/time and TQ1-6 duration, whichever indicates an earlier stopping time. Ordinarily, only one of these fields would be present.

Condition Rule: If the TQ1 segment is repeated in the message, this field must be populated with the appropriate Conjunction code indicating the sequencing of the following TQ1 segment.
