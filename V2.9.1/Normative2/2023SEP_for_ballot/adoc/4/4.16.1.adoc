=== 4.16.1 Usage Notes for Donation Service (Blood Bank)

The Donation Service (BLOOD BANK) uses a different methodology than the similar Transfusion Service (BLOOD BANK) already present in this standard. Each of the segments defined for the Transfusion Service groups together all the 'transfusion' information in one segment, each. The Donation Service was developed breaking out the blood product 'donated' from the donation event itself. This is a more sustainable and interoperable approach. Future changes to the Transfusion Service should uptake this style.
