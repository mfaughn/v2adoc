==== 4.14.1.10 BPO-10 BP Requested Dispense Date/Time (DTM) 01709

Definition: This field specifies the date/time that the requested blood products must be ready to dispense. This date/time may be different from the intended use date/time. For example, the patient may be scheduled to come in for a transfusion at a specified time. However, the placer would request that the blood product be ready to dispense prior to that time in order to have the blood component ready for transfusion at the scheduled time. The field may also be used to indicate that the placer is now ready to pick up the ordered blood product and is requesting the blood product be ready to dispense at that time.
