=== 4.4.19 OSU â€“ Order Status Update Acknowledgement (Event O52) 

This message is used to create simple order status updates, through an acknowledgement, for any type of order where the ORC is sufficient to communicate the order identifier and no other data updates are necessary. This is particularly relevant when a status update occurred in response to a new or updated order. The OSU structure allows it to be used instead of, but equivalent to the application level acknowledgement message, e.g., ORG.
