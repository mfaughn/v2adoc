*Requesting a Chip card*

In case the hospital provides additional services that can be accessed through chip cards, this card has to be issued to the patient. At the end of the visit this chip card is returned. Distributing a chip card to a patient is a service which must be ordered from the chip card dispensing system, too. When discharging the patient the service (= order) is complete.

The messages are essentially the same as for issuing a phone number. The filler for the chip card order is a chip card dispensing application and instead of returning a phone number, it returns a chip card number. The following scenarios have slight variations.

*New Chip Card requested due to, e.g., loss*

When a card is lost, or a new chip card must be requested, an additional fee can be communicated by including the FT1 segment in the ORM^O01 message and valuing FT1-11 = <additional fee>.

*Request a new Chip card for a defective one*

Sometimes a chip card is defective. Then the patient needs a new one. This situation requires an order using the XO control code in the ORM^O01 message. The chip card dispensing system returns the new chip card number using the ORU^RO1. The ORC-16-Order Control Code Reason is used to clarify the request.

*Return a chip card*

When the patient returns the chip card, a discontinue message is send with ORC-1 = "DC". This message is acknowledged accordingly by the chip card dispensing system.

*Printing a form*

When form needs printing, the ORM^O01 could also be used. The OBR segment would contain the print form service and the OBX would contain the specific print form. A notification when completing the printing is feasible as well using the ORM^O01 with a status update associated to the appropriate placer/filler order number.
