=== 4.4.17 OPR â€“ Population/Location-Based Laboratory Order Acknowledgment Message (Event O38)

The function of this message is to respond to an OPL message. An OPR message is the application acknowledgment to an OPL message. See Chapter 2 for a description of the acknowledgment paradigm.

Note: Based upon general message/acknowledgment patterns, it would be expected that this message type would be ORP. However, when this message type was introduced, ORP was already in use as Pharmacy/Treatment Order Acknowledgment.
