Definition: When blank, the modifier applies to all service periods. Diet orders, for example, typically apply to all service periods. This field usually specifies supplements. This field allows you to designate a modification for one or more of the service periods during a day by combining service specifications as needed. The service periods will be local CEs, normally numbers. Suggested are:
