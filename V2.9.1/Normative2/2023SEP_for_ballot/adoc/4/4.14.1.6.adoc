Definition: This field contains the units of measure for the blood product amount. (See Chapter 7 for more details about reporting units.) This field specifies the units of measure for volume of a blood component (i.e., 50 ml) or the units of measure or dosage of a commercial product (i.e., 910 I.U. - International Units - of Factor VIII Concentrate). Use of UCUM is strongly recommended as one of the delivered units (could be in addition to the local units). Refer to Table 0576 - BP Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.
