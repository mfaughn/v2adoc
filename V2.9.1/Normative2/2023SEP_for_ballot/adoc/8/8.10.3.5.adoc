Definition: This field contains the price to be charged for service, item, or procedure. If CDM price will always be overridden when charges are posted, then this field is optional. Otherwise, price would be a required field. The formula or calculation that is to be used to get total price from these price components is left to implementation negotiations agreed upon by the participating institutions. See Chapter 2, section 2.8.8, "CP - composite price," for a description of the use of the composite price (CP) data type.
