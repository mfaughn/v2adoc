Definition: This field contains the test names as type CWE (i.e., <code>^<text name>^<coding system>) that may be ordered automatically by the diagnostic service, depending on the results obtained from the ordered battery. A screening CBC might trigger a reticulocyte count if the Hgb is less than 12. Multiple reflex tests are separated by repeat delimiters. Refer to Table 0641 - Reflex Tests/Observations in Chapter 2C for valid values.
