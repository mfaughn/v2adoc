Definition: This field is used to convey gender restrictions for ordering the test specified in OM1-2 Producer's Service/Test/Observation ID. If there are no restrictions the field is left empty. If the test is restricted to order for certain gender(s), the restricted genders are listed. For example, a Prostate Specific AG (PSA) test is typically ordered only for male patients, thus for PSA the field would be valued 'M' for Male.

Note that the field name is historical as gender restriction for procedures and laboratory tests are based upon Sex Parameter for Clinical Use. Refer to User-defined Table 0001 Administrative Sex â€“ or 0828Sex Parameter for Clinical Use in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.
