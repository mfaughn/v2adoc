Definition: This optional attribute formally indicates the site of the observation (to make it easy for a system to find all tests related to one anatomic site). It can be used to classify the observation by target site of the examination. For example, "heart" might be recorded as the target of the electrocardiogram, cardiac echo, and thallium exercise test. This attribute would be applicable to most imaging and electro-physiologic examinations. The SNOMED topology axis is an example of a coding system for anatomic sites. User-defined tables may also apply here. Refer to Table 0645 - Target Anatomic Site Of Test in Chapter 2C for valid values.
