===== 2.9.4.1.2 Snapshot Mode and Repeating Segment Groups

Treatment of the repeating segment group is analogous to the handling of the repeating segment described above. To indicate deletion of all of the information in a repeating segment group, it is only necessary to delete the anchoring segment of the segment group. This is accomplished just as described above for deleting a repeating segment. This pertains to segments governed by snapshot mode, not action code.

Example: An account is created for Adam Everyman. He is insured under plan ID A357 with an insurance company known to both systems as BCMD, with a company ID of 1234. He is also covered by his wife's insurance under plan ID A789 with an insurance company known to both systems as VGMC, with a company ID of 6789.

Subsequently it is learned that his wife has changed insurance plans. Her new plan is now C45. The insurance company and company ID have remained the same. A BAR^P05 might be sent.

It is later discovered that the patient is not covered by either plan and now has no insurance at all. A BAR^P05 is again sent. In accordance with chapter 6, this can be signaled by showing delete indicator in the plan field.

If, on the other hand, the patient still had his coverage, and only the wife's insurance had been dropped, a fully populated IN1 segment group would be transmitted. The presence of only one IN1 in a subsequent message conveys the "full group replacement" notion. The BAR^P05 would be transmitted and would be interpreted to mean "retain plan A357; delete and other plans":
