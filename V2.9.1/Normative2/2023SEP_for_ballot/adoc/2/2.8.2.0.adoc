==== 2.8.2.0 Accept and validate the message in responding system

Upon receipt of the message, when the Original Acknowledgment rules are used, the protocol software in the responding system validates it against at least the following criteria:

*Note*: Both MSH-15 - accept acknowledgment type and MSH-16 - application acknowledgment type are not present.

{empty}a) the value in link:#_MSH-9___Message Type  (MSG)   00009[MSH-9 Message Type] is one that is acceptable to the receiver.

{empty}b) the value in link:#_MSH-12___Version ID  (VID)   00012[MSH-12 Version ID] is acceptable to the receiver.

{empty}c) the value in link:#_MSH-11___Processing ID  (PT)   0001[MSH-11 Processing ID] is appropriate for the application process handling the message.

If any of these edits fail, the protocol software rejects the message. That is, it creates an ACK message with *AR* in link:#_MSA-1___Acknowledgment Code  (ID)  [MSA-1 Acknowledgment Code].

*Note: If the Acknowledgment Code is other than AA, the reason(s) for the rejection SHOULD be sent in the ERR segment(s) to notify the sender of the exact problem.*

If successful, the process moves to the next step.
