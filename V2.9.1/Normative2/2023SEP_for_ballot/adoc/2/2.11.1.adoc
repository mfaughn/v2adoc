=== 2.11.1 HL7 abstract message syntax example

Consider the hypothetical triggering event *a widget report is requested*. It might be served by the Widget Request (WRQ) and Widget Report (WRP) messages. These would be defined in the Widget chapter (say Chapter XX). The Widget Request message might consist of the following segments: Message Header (MSH), Software Segment (SFT), User Authentication Credentials (UAC), and Widget ID (WID). The Widget Report message might consist of the following segments: Message Header (MSH), Software Segment (SFT), Message acknowledgment (MSA), Error Segment (ERR) and one or more Widget Description (WDN) Segments each of which is followed by a single Widget Portion segment (WPN) followed by zero or more Widget Portion Detail (WPD) segments. The Widget group ends with the optional Inclusion group, which allows a choice of segments/groups.

The ADD and DSC segments follow special rules or protocol as defined in section 2.10.2. They are not represented in the message grammar in the domain chapters as their presence is context sensitive.

The schematic form for this hypothetical exchange of messages is shown in Figure 2-5:

The WID, WDN, WPN, and WPD segments would be defined by the widget committee in the widget chapter, as designated by the Arabic numeral XX in the right column. The MSH and MSA segments, although included in the widget messages, are defined in another chapter. They are incorporated by reference into the widget chapter by the chapter number XX.

On the other hand, the widget committee might decide that the WPN and WPD segments SHALL appear in pairs, but the pairs are optional and can repeat. Then the schematic for the WRP message would be as shown in Figure 2-6.

If the widget committee determined that at least one pair of WPN and WPD segments must follow a WDN, then the notation would be as shown in Figure 2-7.
