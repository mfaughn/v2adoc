=== 2.9.4 Protocol for interpreting repeating segments or segment groups in an update Message 

This section describes the protocol for interpreting repeating segments or segment groups in an update message. Common examples of repeating segments are NK1 and OBX shown as [\{NK1}] and [\{OBX}] in the abstract message syntax. Common examples of segment groups are displayed as \{ORC RXO [\{RXC}]} or [\{IN1 [IN2] [\{IN3}]}] in the abstract message syntax

There are 2 methods of update: the "snapshot" and the "action code/unique identifier" modes. These are defined in sections 2.10.4.1 and 2.10.4.2 below.

If a particular repeating segment can be updated by either of these two modes, the parties concerned will determine by agreement among messaging partners whether an interface will use the "snapshot" mode or the "action code/unique identifier" mode.

Both the sender and receiver of the data must have predictable rules for how they will process the data in repeating segments or segment groups regardless of which mode is used. This SHOULD be documented in the Conformance Profile. It is critical to know, for instance, if the Sender is the System of Record.
