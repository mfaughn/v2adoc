==== 2.9.4.2 Action code/unique identifier mode update definition

In the "action code/unique identifier" mode (action code mode), each member of a segment or segment group can be acted upon independently of the other members. Thus, it is possible to delete or update a member of the set without including the other members of the set. The choice of delete/update/insert is determined by the action code (or an equivalent such as result status in an ORU Observation Report message). Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70206[_HL7 Table 0206 - Segment Action Code_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

The _unique identifier_ unambiguously identifies one of multiple repetitions of the repeating segment or segment group in a way that does not change over time. It is not dependent on any particular message identifier level (MSH) fields; it functions across messages, not just within a message. For a single segment repetition, the _unique identifier_ MAY be an explicit field (e.g., IAM-7 Allergy Unique Identifier) or a combination of fields (IAM suggests IAM-3 Allergen Identifier in the context of the particular patient). For a repeating segment group, an identifier in the anchoring segment would identify the repeating set. For MFN messages, MFI-1 Master File Identifier and MFE-4 Primary Key Value identify the particular table and record.

Example 1: If a patient is allergic to penicillin and shellfish, the following message would be sent showing an Action code of "A(dd) in IAM-6:

MSH|||||||||ADT^A60^ADT_A60|...<cr>

EVN|...<cr>

PID|...<cr>

IAM|1||peni|||A<cr>

IAM|2||shell||A<cr>

Subsequently, if it is learned that the patient is not allergic to shellfish, the following message would be sent showing an Action code of "D(elete) in IAM-6:

MSH|||||||||ADT^A60^ADT_A60|...<cr>

EVN|...<cr>

PID|...<cr>

IAM|1||shell||D<cr>

Some messages, Orders and Observations, in particular, do not use table 0206. Order control codes are used to unambiguously specify the action to be taken.

Example 2: if a set of orders had been sent as

MSH|||||||||OML^O21^OML_O21|...<cr>

PID|...

ORC|NW|987654^CIS|...<cr>

ORC|NW|876543^CIS|...<cr>

ORC|NW|765432^CIS|...<cr>

and subsequently order 876543 was cancelled, the following message would target that specific segment instance without affecting the other orders. ORC-1 contains order control code "CA" for cancel. ORC-2 identifies the specific order number.

MSH|||||||||OML^O21^ OML_O21|...<cr>

PID|

ORC|CA|876543^CIS|...<cr>

Example 3: Add staff person to Provider master:
