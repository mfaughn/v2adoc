=== 2.4.1 Messages 

____
A *message* is the atomic unit of data transferred between systems. It is comprised of a group of segments in a defined sequence. Each message has a *message type* that defines its purpose. For example the ADT Message type is used to transmit portions of a patient's Patient Administration (ADT) data from one system to another. A three-character code contained within each message identifies its type. These are listed in the Message Type list, Appendix A.

The real-world event that initiates an exchange of messages is called a trigger event. See Section _2.2.2_, "_Trigger events_," for a more detailed description of trigger events. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70003[_HL7 Tabl__e_ _0003 â€“ Event type_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for a listing of all defined trigger events. These codes represent values such as *A patient is admitted* or *An order event occurred*. There is a one-to-many relationship between message types and trigger event codes. The same trigger event code SHALL NOT be associated with more than one message type; however a message type MAY be associated with more than one trigger event code.

All message types and trigger event codes beginning with the letter "Z" are reserved for locally defined messages. Z codes SHALL NOT be defined within the HL7 Standard.
