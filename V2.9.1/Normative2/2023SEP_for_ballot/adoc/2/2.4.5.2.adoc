==== 2.4.5.2 Truncation Pattern

____
For technical and/or architectural reasons, many applications must define a limit to the length that they will store for a particular item. This creates a need for the length of an element to be defined somewhere and raises the question of what is intended to happen if a real world value is longer than the acceptable value. The problem of how to handle this is unaffected by whether it is the standard that defines the length, or the receiving system that defines the length: what can be done?

The most obvious response is that the data must be rejected, and either the message cannot be constructed or must be rejected completely. For some data items, this is the only clinically safe behaviour.On the other hand, for some data items such as names and addresses, this is generally unwelcome information – the system can still function to some degree in the presence of truncated data.

However truncation of data can have later consequences – if a data item such as a particularly long surname is truncated, and then returned to the source application in the truncated form, the source application might not correctly match on the truncated name.

For this reason, when values are truncated because they are too long (whether because some applicable specification limits the length of the item, or because the application is not able to store the full value), the value SHOULD be truncated at N-1, where N is the length limit, and the final character replaced with a special truncation character. This means that whenever that value is subsequently processed later, either by the system, a different system, or a human user, the fact that the value has been truncated has been preserved, and the information can be handled accordingly.

The truncation character is not fixed; applications MAY use any character. The truncation character used in the message is defined in MSH-2. The default truncation character in a message is # (ASCII 35, HEX 23),because the character must come from the narrow range of allowed characters in an instance. The truncation character only represents truncation when it appears as the last character of a truncatable field. It SHALL be escaped if the last character of the data that is the maximum allowable size for the component is the truncation character.

Example:

For a field with a conformance length of 5 where the content is |1234\P\| the truncation character is not representing truncation, it is the actual data.

*Note:* The selection of # as truncation character is taken from ISO 22220 and 27527.
