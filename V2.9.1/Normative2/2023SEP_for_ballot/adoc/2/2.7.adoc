== 2.7 Version compatibility definition 

____
The rules, described in section _2.5_, _Message construction rules,_ for receiving HL7 messages and converting their contents to data values allow the following definition of a backward compatibility requirement between the 2.x versions of HL7:

*Note*: If an issue is not covered explicitly under these rules, no assumption SHOULD be made that the change is allowed.

The keys to understanding version compatibility are the following 2 axioms, plus the processing rules which state that unexpected information SHOULD be discarded.

• Old receivers receiving new messages SHOULD be able to continue receiving messages without error.

• New receivers SHOULD be able to understand old messages.

This section elaborates on what the kinds of changes can be done that satisfies these axioms. Only HL7 changes introduced in new versions are included. Local extensions are discussed in section _2.10_, "_Local Extension_".
