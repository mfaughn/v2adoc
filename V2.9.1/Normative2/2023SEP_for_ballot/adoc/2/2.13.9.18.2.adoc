===== 2.13.9.18.2 Non-Alphabetic Languages

HL7 Table 0211 includes values for languages that do not use alphabets. These include ideographic written languages, such as the Japanese Graphic Character Set which is specified as *ISO IR87*.

There are non-alphabetic encoding systems for which HL7 Table 0211 does not provide specific entries. One of these is the Traditional Chinese character set, CNS 11643, which is used in Taiwan. This character set can, however, be encoded using the Unicode Standard, which does have a value in HL7 0211.

The Unicode Standard (which is now coordinated with ISO 10646) permits the specification of multiple-byte characters in a much larger range than is available in a single-byte ASCII or ISO character set. Unicode Version 3.1 (http://www.unicode.org) includes almost 100,000 characters, including many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ideographs. This is particularly valuable to implementers who need to encode messages in more than one character set, as for example to accommodate the use of both alphabetic and ideographic characters.

Non-alphabetic encoding systems do not restrict characters to a length of one byte. Unicode incorporates three encoding forms that allow for the use of multiple bytes to encode a message. The most flexible Unicode encoding form is UTF-8, which uses high-order bits to specify the number of bytes (from one to six) used to encode each character.

Interestingly, Unicode UTF-8 incorporates the 7-bit ASCII character set as single-byte codes. This means that a message encoded in 7-bit ASCII can be submitted to a destination using Unicode UTF- 8 with no modification.
