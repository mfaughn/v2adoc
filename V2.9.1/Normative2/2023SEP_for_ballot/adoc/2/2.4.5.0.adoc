==== 2.4.5.0 Normative Length

____
For some fields or components, the value domain of the content leads to clearly established boundaries for minimum and/or maximum length of the content. In these cases, these known limits are specified for the item. Normative lengths are only specified for primitive data types.

Examples of value domains that have clearly established boundaries for minimum and maximum length:

• A date/time field: See 2.A.22 DTM date/time for detailed examples.

o 4..4 for year

o 4..6 for Year to month

o 8..8 for year to day

• A component whose values are limited to a set of fixed length strings, e.g.(ABC, SYL, or IDE)A component that contains a reference to a field in a message

The information is given in one of two forms:

• The minimum and the maximum length separated by two dots, e.g. m..n

• the list of possible values for length separated by commas, e.g. x,y,z

When a normative length is asserted and assertion is a range, conformant messages SHALL have a length that lies within the boundaries specified. The boundaries are inclusive, so a length of 1..2 means the length of the item SHALL be either 1 or 2. When a normative length is asserted and assertion is a list of values, conformant messages SHALL have a length that is one of the values in the list.
____

*Note:* The minimum length is always 1 or more. If an item is optional, and there is no content present, the item is considered as not populated, rather than present with a length of 0.

*Note:* The deletion indicator is treated as having no length and therefore fits to all length specifications.
