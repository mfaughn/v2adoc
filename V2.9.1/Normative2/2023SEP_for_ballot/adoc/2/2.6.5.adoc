=== 2.6.5 Special character

____
The special character escape sequences (\F\, \S\, \R\, \T\, \P\ and \E\) allow the corresponding characters to be included in the data in a text field, though the actual characters are reserved. For example, the message fragment

DSP| TOTAL CHOLESTEROL 180 \F\90 - 200\F\

DSP| \S\----------------\S\

would cause the following information to be displayed, given suitable assignment of separators:

TOTAL CHOLESTEROL 180 |90 - 200|
