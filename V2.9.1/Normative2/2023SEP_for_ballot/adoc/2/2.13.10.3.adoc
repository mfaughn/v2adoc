==== 2.13.10.3 NTE-3 Comment (FT) 00098

Definition: This field contains the comment contained in the segment.

Conditionality Predicate: In support of backwards compatibility, when NTE-9 is populated, the sending system SHALL also populate a human-readable version of the comment in NTE-3. When NTE-9 is not populated then NTE-3 MAY be populated.

*Note: NTE-3 has been left blank for the use cases where legacy systems are sending a blank NTE as a line feed.*

*Note:* As of v2.2, this field uses the FT rather than a TX data type. Since there is no difference between an FT data type without any embedded formatting commands, and a TX data type, this change is compatible with the previous version.
