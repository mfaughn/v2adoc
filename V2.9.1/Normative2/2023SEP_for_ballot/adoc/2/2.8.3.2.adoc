==== 2.8.3.2 Transmit application acknowledgment

If the message header segment indicates that the initiating system also requires an application acknowledgment, this SHALL be returned as the initial message of a later exchange.

For this message, the receiving system acts as the initiator. Since the message it sends is application‑specific, the layouts of these application-level response messages are defined in the relevant application-specific chapter. If needed, this application acknowledgment message can itself require (in link:#_MSH-15___Accept Acknowledgment Type[MSH-15 Accept Acknowledgment Type]) an accept acknowledgment message (MSA). link:#_MSH-16___Application Acknowledgment[MSH-16 Application Acknowledgment Type], however, is always NE(Never), since the protocol does not allow the application acknowledgment message to have an application acknowledgment.

For this response, the following values are put in the MSA segment. Note that the field definitions for the MSA segment fields are in Section _2.13.8_, "_MSA ‑ Message Acknowledgment segment_".

|Field |Notes
|MSA-2-message control ID |Identifies the initial message from the original initiating system as defined in Section _2.8.1_, "_Message initiation_".
|MSA-1-acknowledgment code |Uses the application (processing) acknowledgment codes as described in Section _2.13.8.1_.
|MSA-3-text message |Text description of error.q
|ERR segment fields |Refer to section link:#err-error-segment[ERR - error segment]

At this point, the application acknowledgment portion of this message exchange is considered complete.

If the processing on the receiving system goes through multiple stages, chapter-defined messages MAY be used to relay status or informational changes to other systems (including the original initiating system). Such messages are not part of the acknowledgment scheme for the original message, but are considered to be independent messages triggered by events on the (original) responding system.

*Note*: There is no equivalent to the V2.1 original acknowledgment protocol, where the acknowledgment is always sent as a response on the same communications channel. The enhanced acknowledgment protocol with MSH-15 (accept acknowledgment type) = NE and MSH-16 (application acknowledgment type) = AL still requires that the application acknowledgment is sent on a separate communications channel.
