==== 2.8.3.0 Accept and validate the message in responding system

Upon receipt of the message, , the protocol software in the responding system makes an initial determination as to whether or not the message can be accepted, based on factors such as:

*Note:* Both MSH-15-accept acknowledgment type and MSH-16-application acknowledgment type SHALL BE valued.

{empty}a) the status of the interface

{empty}b) the availability of safe storage onto which the message can be saved

{empty}c) the syntactical correctness of the message, if the design of the receiving system includes this type of validation at this phase

{empty}d) the values of link:#_MSH-9___Message Type  (MSG)   00009[MSH-9 Message Type], link:#msh-12-version-id-vid-00012[MSH-12 Version ID], and link:#_MSH-11___Processing ID  (PT)   0001[MSH-11 Processing ID], if the design of the receiving system includes this type of validation at this phase

It then examines the Message Header segment (MSH) to determine whether or not the initiating system requires an accept acknowledgment.
