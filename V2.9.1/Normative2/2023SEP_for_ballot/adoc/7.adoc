== 7.2 Purpose

This chapter describes the transaction set required for sending structured patient-oriented clinical data from one computer system to another. A common use of these transaction sets will be to transmit observations and results of diagnostic studies from the producing system (e.g., clinical laboratory system, EKG system) (the filler), to the ordering system (e.g., HIS order entry, physician's office system) (the placer). Observations can be sent from producing systems to clinical information systems (not necessarily the order placer) and from such systems to other systems that were not part of the ordering loop, e.g., an office practice system of the referring physician for inpatient test results ordered by an inpatient surgeon. This chapter also provides mechanisms for registering clinical trials and methods for linking orders and results to clinical trials and for reporting experiences with drugs and devices.

These transaction sets permit the transmission of clinical observations including (but not limited to) clinical laboratory results, measures of patient status and condition, vital signs, intake and output, severity and/or frequency of symptoms.

If the observation being reported meets one or more of the following criteria, then the content would qualify as a medical document management message (MDM) rather than an observation message (ORU). The reader is referred to the MDM message type in Chapter 9.

• Documents/reports that require succession management to reflect the evolution of both document addenda and replacement documents. Succession management is described in Chapter 9.

• Documents/reports where the Sender wants to indicate the availability of the report for use in patient care using the availability status present in the TXA segment, as described in Chapter 9.

Additional considerations that may affect the appropriateness of using an MDM message:

• Documents/reports where the whole requires a signature as part of the message. While the ORU message does not support the inclusion of signature or authentication, some document content forms support these requirements. Of particular note, CDA documents provide for the inclusion of originator/signature. Thus, if a CDA document requires a signature but does not require succession management or report availability (as described above), then an ORU message may be appropriate. However, if the CDA document requires succession management or report availability, then an MDM message is required.

• Documents/reports where the whole requires authentication as part of the message. As described for signatures, authentication may exist within the document content form. Again, CDA documents provide for the identification of an authenticator. Thus if a CDA document does not require succession management or report availability, then an ORU message may be appropriate. If succession management or report availability are necessary, then an MDM message is required.

• Documents/reports where the content as a whole requires special confidentiality protection using the confidentiality status present in the TXA segment, as described in Chapter 9.

• Documents/reports where document storage status is useful for archival and purging purposes using the storage status present in the TXA segment, as described in Chapter 9.

Using these criteria, the following examples of documents/reports would typically qualify as medical document management (MDM) messages. Note that as clinical content, the following documents/reports typically require succession management and/or report availability thus would require an MDM message even if the payload utilizes CSA.

• History and Physical

• Consultation reports

• Discharge summaries

• Surgical/anatomic pathology reports

• Diagnostic imaging reports

• Cardio-diagnostic reports

• Operative reports

• As an international example, microbiology reports may include clinical interpretation and require authentication. This may not be the case in all jurisdictions, but is an example that the use or requirement of MDM messages may be influenced by local considerations.

Usage Notes:

Transcription is not a defining quality for the selection of an MDM or ORU message. In an MDM message, the document/report is typically dictated or transcribed, but not always. Machine-generated or automated output is an example of a document/report that is appropriate to the MDM but is not transcribed.

Observations may be transmitted in a solicited (in response to a query) or unsolicited mode. In the solicited mode, a user requests a set of observations according to criteria transmitted by the user. The sending system responds with existing data to satisfy the query (subject to access controls). Queries do not elicit new observations by the target system, they simply retrieve old observations. (See Chapter 5 for full discussion of the query transmission.)

The unsolicited mode is used primarily to transmit the values of new observations. It is the mode used by producing services to return the values of observations requested by an ordering system. A laboratory system, for example, would usually send the results of an AM electrolytes to the ordering HIS via the unsolicited mode. An intensive care system would send the blood pressures to the same HIS by the same mode. Calling such transactions unsolicited may sound like a misnomer, but is not. The placing service solicits the producing service to make the observation. It could also (through a query) solicit the value of that observation after it has been made. However, such an approach would demand continuous polling of the producing system until the result was produced. Using the unsolicited mode, the producing service returns the value of an observation as soon as it is available. The unsolicited mode can also be used to transmit new results to a system (e.g., an archival medical record system) that did not order the observation. The transactions that define these modes are more fully described in Section _7.3_, "_General Trigger Events & Message Definitions_."

Observations are usually ordered and reported as sets (batteries) of many separate observations. Physicians order electrolytes (consisting of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate) or vitals (consisting of diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, pulse, and temperature). Moreover, tests that we may think of as single entity, e.g., cardiac echo, usually yield multiple separate measurements, e.g., left ventricular diameter, left atrial diameter, etc. Moreover, observations that are usually reported as text (e.g., the review of systems from the history and physical) can also be considered a set of separately analyzable units (e.g., cardiac history, pulmonary history, genito-urinary history, etc.). We strongly suggest that all text clinical reports be broken down into such separate analyzable entities and that these individual entities be transmitted as separate OBX segments. Because many attributes of a set of observations taken at one time will be identical, one OBR segment serves as a header for the report and carries the information that applies to all of the individual observations in the set. In the case of ordered observations, the OBR segment is a "turn-around document" like the manual request forms it replaces. It carries information about the order to the producing service; a copy of the OBR with additional fields completed is returned with the observations to the requesting service. Alternately, text documents can be encoded as a CDA document and sent within a single OBX.

Not all observations are preceded by an order. However, all observations whether explicitly ordered or initiated without an order are reported with an OBR segment as the report header.

The major segments (OBR, OBX) defined in this chapter, their fields, and the code tables have been defined in collaboration with ASTM E31.11 with the goal of keeping HL7 observation transmission the same as ASTM E1238 in pursuit of the goals of ANSI HISPP and the Message Standards Developers Subcommittee. (Some sections of this chapter have been taken with permission directly from the E1238‑91 document and vice versa in pursuit of those goals).

The OBR segment provides information that applies to all of the observations that follow. It includes a field that identifies a particular battery (or panel or set) of observations (e.g., electrolytes, vital signs or Admission H&P). For simplicity we will refer to the observation set as the battery. The battery usually corresponds to the entity that is ordered or performed as a unit. (In the case of a query, observation sets may be a more arbitrary collection of observations.) The OBX segment provides information about a single observation, and it includes a field that identifies that single observation (e.g., potassium, diastolic blood pressure or admission diagnosis). Both of these fields assume master tables that define coding systems (the universe of valid identifying codes) for batteries and observations, respectively. These tables will usually be part of the producing and sending services application and (usually) include many other useful pieces of information about the observation or battery. Segments for transmitting such master file information between systems that produce and systems that use clinical information are described in Chapter 8.

This Standard does not require the use of a particular coding system to identify either batteries or single observations In the past, local institutions tended to invent their own unique code systems for identifying test and other clinical observations because standard codes were not available. Such local code systems sufficed for transmitting information within the institutions but presented high barriers to pooling data from many sources for research or for building medical record systems. However, standard code systems such as LOINC® for observation IDs (OBX-3) and SNOMED for coding categorical observations now exist for many of these purposes, and we strongly encourage their use in observation reporting. These codes can be sent either as the only code or they can be sent along with the local historic code as the second code system in a CWE or CNE coded field.

LOINC® codes exist for most laboratory tests and many common clinical variables and codes for reporting observations from the laboratory, 12-lead EKG, cardiac echoes, obstetrical ultrasounds, radiology reports, history and physical findings, tumor registries, vital signs, intake and outputs, UCUM units of measure references and/or answer lists depending on the data type, and descriptions for most variables. Translations of LOINC® descriptions are provided for more than 14 languages. The most recent version of the LOINC® database, which includes records for more than 70,000 observations and includes codes, names, synonyms and other attributes (such as the molecular weights of chemical moieties) for each observation, the LOINC database and a downloadable browser and mapping tool are available at no cost from the Regenstrief Institute at _http://loinc.org/_. A web browser for LOINC is available at https://search.loinc.org. Codes for Neurophysiologic variables (EEG, EMG, Evoked potentials) are provided in Appendix X2 of ASTM E1467. Some parts of this document (the discussion and tables defining units, the discussion of the rules of mapping observations to OBX segments, and some of the examples at the end of the chapter) have been copied (with permission) from ASTM E1238.

As is true throughout this Standard, the emphasis should be on the abstract messages, defined without regard to the encoding rules. The example messages, however, are based upon the HL7 encoding rules.

=== 7.2.1 Snapshot Mode

Chapter 2, Section 2.10.4 defines the meaning of snapshot mode updates and indicates that each chapter or related implementation guides may further refine this definition. The following guidance applies to results messages:

• In some instances there are tests that have a precise relationship between the parent and child to assist the clinician in understanding to which OBX in the parent OBR the child is connected. In those instances the ORDER_OBSERVATION segment groups of the parent and other children should be included in the snapshot rather than sending the child's ORDER_OBSERVATION segment group (including the OBR/OBX set) by itself. Example: OBRs of the parent OBR (example would be microbiology with culture and Sensitivity Panels (Sensi-Panels)), unless advised otherwise by trading partners, would be included in the snapshot reporting. 

=== 7.2.2 Preface (organization of this chapter)

Following this Purpose and general information section, the remainder of this chapter is organized into four main subject areas; General, Clinical Trials, Product Experience and Waveform. Sections 7.1 to 7.5 document the trigger events, message definitions, segment definitions and examples for general observation reporting. Sections 7.6 to 7.9 include all information related to Clinical Trials. Sections 7.10 to 7.13 include all information related to Product Experience messaging, and sections 7.14 to 7.17 include Waveform messaging information. Large tables can be found in section 7.18 and outstanding issues are listed in section 7.19.

=== 7.2.3 Glossary

==== 7.2.3.0 hiddentext

==== 7.2.3.1 Placer:

Person or service that requests (places order for) an observation battery, e.g., the physician, the practice, clinic, or ward service, that orders a lab test, X-ray, vital signs, etc. The meaning is synonymous with, and used interchangeably with, requestor. See _ORC-2-placer order number_, Chapter 4, section 4.5.1.2, "Placer order number."

==== 7.2.3.2 Filler:

Person, or service, who produces the observations (fills the order) requested by the requestor. The word is synonymous with "producer" and includes diagnostic services and clinical services and care providers who report observations about their patients. The clinical laboratory is a producer of lab test results (filler of a lab order), the nursing service is the producer of vital signs observations (the filler of orders to measure vital signs), and so on. See _ORC-3-filler order number_, Chapter 2, section 4.5.1.3, "Filler order number."

==== 7.2.3.3 Battery:

A set of one or more observations identified as by a single name and code number, and treated as a shorthand unit for ordering or retrieving results of the constituent observations. In keeping with the mathematical conventions about set, a battery can be a single observation. Vital signs, electrolytes, routine admission tests, and obstetrical ultrasound are all examples. Vital signs (conventionally) consist of diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. Electrolytes usually consist of Na+, K+, Cl‑, and HCO3‑. Routine admission tests might contain CBC, Electrolytes, SMA12, and Urinalysis. (Note that the elements of a battery for our purposes may also be batteries.) Obstetrical ultrasound is a battery made up of traditional component measurements and the impression, all of which would be returned as separate results when returned to the requestor. A test involving waveform recording (such as an EKG) can be represented as a battery comprised of results of many categories, including digital waveform data, labels and annotations to the data, measurements, and the impression

The word battery is used in this specification synonymously with the word profile or panel. The individual observation elements within a battery may be characteristic of a physiologic system (e.g., liver function tests), or many different physiologic systems.

==== 7.2.3.4 Observation:

A measurement of a single variable or a single value derived logically and/or algebraically from other measured or derived values. A test result, a diastolic blood pressure, and a single chest X-ray impression are examples of observations. In certain circumstances, tracings and images may be treated by HL7 as individual observations and sent as a single OBX. These include waveform data described in section _7.15_, "_Waveform – Trigger Events & Message Definitions_," and encapsulated data aggregates using the ED data type described in Chapter 2A, section 2.A.24, "ED - encapsulated data," (which can represent actual images, audio data, etc.).

==== 7.2.3.5 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA):

The Health Level 7 Specification (ANSI/HL7 CDA R1.0-2000) for encoding and encapsulating clinical documents.

=== 7.2.4 Narrative Reports as Batteries with Many OBX 

Narrative reports from services such as Radiology usually consist of a number of subcomponents (e.g., a chest X-ray report may consist of a description, an impression, and a recommendation). Other studies, such as echocardiograms, contain analogous components, as well as numeric observations (e.g., left ventricular and diastolic diameter). Surgical pathology reports may contain information about multiple specimens and reports: the anatomic source, the gross description, the microscopic description, and a diagnostic impression for each specimen.

The current Standard treats each component of a narrative report as a separate "test" or observation. Just as a CHEM12 is transmitted as an order segment (OBR) plus 12 OBX segments, a chest X-ray would be transmitted as an order (OBR) segment plus three OBX segments, one for the description, one for the impression, and one for the recommendations. Similarly, an EKG report would be transmitted as an order segment (OBR), two OBX segments for the impression and recommendation, and additional OBX segments for each EKG measurement, e.g., the PR interval, QR interval, QRS axis, and so on.

=== 7.2.5 Suffixes for Defining Observation IDs for Common Components of Narrative Reports

*Retained for backwards compatability only as of V2.7 and withdrawn as of v2.9, in favor of using LOINC codes that pre-coordinate the appropriate identifiers with the suffices. See Chapter 2.8.4.c.*

== 7.3 General Trigger Events & Message Definitions

The triggering events that follow are all served by the ORU (Unsolicited Observation Message, Unsolicited Point-of-Care Observation Message, Unsolicited Alert Observation Message), the OUL (Observational Report – Automated Lab), or the OPU (Observational Report - Population) messages in combination with ACK and ORA (Observational Report - Application Acknowledgement). Each triggering event is listed below, along with the messages exchanged, and the segments that comprise the messages. The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality, and repeating of segments is described in Chapter 2, "Format for defining abstract messages."

=== 7.3.1 ORU – Unsolicited Observation Message (Event R01) 

The ORU message is for transmitting observational results, including lab, clinical or other observations, to other systems.. The OUL message is designed to accommodate the laboratory processes of laboratory automation systems.

With the segment (OBX) defined in this chapter, and the OBR defined in Chapter 4, one can construct almost any clinical report as a multi-level hierarchy, with the PID segment defined in Chapter 3 at the upper level, an order record (OBR) at the next level with one or more observation records (OBX), followed by the specimen information (SPM) and one or more observations (OBX) directly associated with the specimen.

One result segment (OBX) is transmitted for each component of a diagnostic report, such as an EKG or obstetrical ultrasound or electrolyte battery.

The CTD segment in this trigger is used to transmit temporary patient contact details specific to this order.

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

*Note:* The ORC is permitted but not required in this message. Any information that could be included in either the ORC or the OBR must be included in the OBR on reporting. Notice also that the ORU (and the QRY) messages accommodate reports about many patients.

Many report headers (OBR) may be sent beneath each patient segment, with many separate observation segments (OBX) related to the order / observation request beneath each OBR. OBX segments that are related to specimens immediately follow the SPM segments. Note segments (NTE) may be inserted at different locations in the message. The note segment applies to the entity that immediately precedes it, i.e., the patient if it follows the PID segment, the observation request if it follows the OBR segment, and the individual result if it follows the OBX segment.

=== 7.3.4 ORU – Unsolicited Point-Of-Care Observation Message without Existing Order – Place an Order (Event R30) 

This event trigger instructs the receiving system to create a new order for the observation(s) contained in the message.

One example of this trigger's use case occurs when a Doctor verbally instructs a nurse to perform a test. Looking at this use case from an information management perspective, one might expect that, the nurse would enter an order into laboratory information or ordering system before performing the test. However, there usually isn't time for order entry in these use cases. In fact, it is highly desirable for the POC measurement process to become automated so that the only action a user needs to take is to make a measurement on the POC Device, with all other processes for generating an order and tying it in to the observation handled by the "machines."

In order to allow for the passing of specific information relating to the Patient, responsible Doctor, placing doctor, patient location, etc., there is a requirement for the inclusion of a PV1 and PD1 segment in the ORU message type. One example of this trigger's use case occurs when a Doctor at a remote site without a shared Patient index instructs a nurse to perform a test. The testing is carried out without prior entry of a request into the LIS. Once performed, the results, along with the patient information are transmitted to the LIS. In some circumstances, the LIS may add clinical interpretation to this and report it back to the placing system and/or another system. In order to allow for this to take place, the requester, location, etc., information is required.

To allow the sending system to correlate every result with its associated order, the receiving system will return the placer order number in the ORC segment of the ORA^R33 message. If the receiving system cannot place an order it must returning an application level error description in the Application Acknowledgement Message MSA Text Message field.

The sending system must return a commit-level acknowledgement in response to the ORA^R33 message.

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

=== 7.3.5 ORU – Unsolicited New Point-Of-Care Observation Message – Search for an Order (Event R31)

This event trigger instructs the receiving system to search for an existing order for the observation(s) contained in the message.

In this case, the sending system does not know if an order has been placed. This transaction instructs the receiving system to search for an existing order for the associated results. If the receiver finds an existing order, it should return the Placer ID to the sender in the ORC segment of an OML^O21 message. This information allows the Observation Reviewer to correlate every result with its associated order.

The institution's business rules will determine what the receiving system does if it can't find a matching order. Possibilities include automatically placing an order (as in trigger event R30), or returning an application level error description in the Application Acknowledgement MSA Text Message field..

If it is necessary to pass specific information related to the Patient, responsible Doctor, placing doctor, patient location etc, there is a requirement for the inclusion of a PV1 and PD1 segment in the ORU message type (see also ORU^R30 for description).

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

=== 7.3.6 ORU – Unsolicited Pre-Ordered Point-Of-Care Observation (Event R32)

This event trigger instructs the receiver to place the result with the order information included in the message.

From a traditional clinical laboratory perspective, this event trigger's use case is probably the predominant (if not exclusive) one. However, in the POC environment, it is actually uncommon to have an order already generated when a test is performed. It does happen sometimes, though. If it is necessary to pass specific information related to the Patient, responsible Doctor, placing doctor, patient location, etc., there is a requirement for the inclusion of a PV1 and PD1 segment in the ORU message type (see also ORU^R30 for description).

If the receiving system accepts both the order and the result, it will return an ORA^R33 Application Acknowledgement message with the acknowledgement code of AA. A comment may be included in the Acknowledgement Message MSA Text Message field.

If the receiving system is unable to accept both the order and the result, no order or result should be placed and an ACK^33 Application Acknowledgement message must be returned to the sender with the error identified in the MSA Text Message field.

The sending system must return a commit-level acknowledgement in response to the ORA^R33 message.

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

=== 7.3.8 OUL – Unsolicited Specimen Oriented Observation Message (Event R22 )

This message was designed to accommodate specimen oriented testing. It should be applicable to container-less testing (e.g., elephant on a table) and laboratory automation systems requiring container.

Generally this construct allows transfer of multiple results related to a specimen from a patient, where this specimen has been in none, one, or multiple containers.

In addition to the patient results themselves it permits the communication of the following kinds of information:

• Analysis results of a non patient related sample (e.g., environmental) – patient related segments (e.g., PID, PD1, PV1, PV2) are optional.

• Analysis results to a particular container with QC sample and the lot and manufacturer information about this sample (SAC-INV segments) – however for this purpose the "Unsolicited Specimen Container Oriented Observation Message" (OUL^R23) is recommended due to explicit relation between the observation and the container.

• Basic identification data (lot, manufacturer, etc.) of the reagents and other substances involved in the generation of analysis results (TCD-SID segments).

Refer to Chapter 13 Laboratory Automation for additional examples of usage of SAC.

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

• Analysis results of a non patient related sample (e.g., environmental) – patient related segments (e.g., PID, PD1, PV1, PV2) are optional.

• Analysis results to a particular container with QC sample and the lot and manufacturer information about this sample (SAC-INV segments).

• Basic identification data (lot, manufacturer, etc.) of the reagents and other substances involved in the generation of analysis results (TCD-SID segments).

Refer to Chapter 13 Laboratory Automation for additional examples of usage of SAC.

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).

=== 7.3.11 OPU – Unsolicited Population/Location-Based Laboratory Observation Message (Event R25)

This message supports unsolicited population or location-based surveillance reporting to a central repository where the accession / visit may contain references to multiple patients, multiple specimens, non-patient specimens, and multiple orders per specimen.

This message structure represents the way most submissions to veterinary laboratories occur. There is a multi-tier hierarchy in which a single individual (for example, a veterinarian or an owner of a production facility) submits one or more specimen samples from one or more animals or non-living entity, such as environmental specimens or feed. This grouped submission of specimens from multiple animal 'patients' is usually referred to as an 'accession' which can be considered analogous to a 'visit' in the veterinary laboratory context. This is what accounts for the unusual structure where the PV1 segment precedes a repeatable ACCESSION_DETAIL group.

Since specimens can originate from non-patients the PATIENT group is optional. This allows for specimens that are both associated with patients as well as those associated with non-patients to be included under the same accession (visit). Each specimen may have one or more orders assigned, each of which may have one or more individual results.

The OBX segment at the visit level provides the reason for submission. The repeatable PRT segment at the visit level represents the person(s) or organization submitting the request and other interested parties and locations who (that) play a role in the disposition of the accession/visit.

The NK1 segment contains owner and/or responsible party information for the patient and/or specimen.

=== 7.3.12 ORU – Unsolicited Alert Observation Message (Event R40) 

The R40 trigger event is used for observation reports that include an alertable condition, i.e., for which some timely human or application intervention in patient care may be indicated by the findings. The ORA^R41 provides the application level response to the ORU^R40.

The ORU^R40 message is outside of the order-fulfilling cycle of the ORU and OUL messages with other trigger events, and is supplemental to those order-fulfilling observations. As such, the results conveyed in the ORU^R40 do not replace, edit, or override the results of messages with other trigger events.

The ORU^R40 message represents a unitary alert, which is to be acknowledged as a whole by an ORA message. Multiple alerts requiring separate acknowledgement must be sent as individual messages.

The ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Group which has OBR-49 value A (Alert provider when abnormal) conveys the alert observation(s). One or more OBX segments in this Segment Group will typically have OBX-8 Interpretation Codes value of LL. HH, or AA. At least one OBR segment shall have OBR-49 value A. Other ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Groups within the message shall be considered supporting information for the alert observation(s).

An alert observation report may simply replicate observations conveyed in another observation message, e.g., sent in an ORU^R01 (the source observation). In such an instance the ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Group shall replicate the OBR (and ORC, if present) of the source observation.

An alert observation reporting application may also derive a new alertable observation, e.g., from a combination of other observations from multiple orders, processed by a clinical decision support rule set. In this case, the ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Group with the alertable observation may use an OBR representing the "order" for clinical decision support, with this instance uniquely identified in the OBR-51 Observation Group ID. Supporting source observations may be conveyed in subsequent ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Groups in the message using their original OBR information.

If the reporting application can identify a preferred recipient for the alert, that may be conveyed in the PRT segment related to the OBR or OBX (with PRT-4 value RCT "Results Copies To"). This recipient may not be the same as the recipient(s) identified in a source observation. There is no expectation that the reporting application will _a priori_ know a preferred recipient, nor that the receiving application will deliver the alert to the identified recipient (e.g., it may be delivered to an "on-call" clinician in lieu of the identified recipient).

=== 7.3.13 ORA – Observation Report Alert Acknowledgement (Event R41) 

This message enables application level acknowledgements in response to the ORU^R40 alert observation message.

The R41 trigger event is used to indicate that the alert observation has been delivered to, and acknowledged by, a clinical user. If the clinical user can be identified, that identity can be conveyed in the PRT segment (with PRT-4 value AAP Alert Acknowledging Provider).

Considering that the alerts may be received by multiple providers, multiple acknowledgements may be returned. The behavior associated with the user acknowledgement may be specified in a local implementation agreement or implementation guide and may be indicated in MSH-21 Message Profile Identifier.

=== 7.3.14 ORU – Unsolicited Device Event Observation Message (Event R42) 

The R42 trigger event is used for observation reports that identify a device-sourced event (e.g., transition on an infusion pump between primary and secondary modes of operation) that is relevant to clinical workflow but that does not require a response from a clinician or clinical management system (in which case, an R40 alert message should be used). These events are episodic (vs. periodic), require low latency and appropriate prioritized handling (i.e., should be communicated immediately after the event is signaled), and typically require low transmission bandwidth. R42 messages do not need to provide for an application level response, as does the ORU^R40 message (via the ORA^R41 message).

Use examples of this message include:

____
• Electronic medication administration record (eMAR) systems that record the pre-programmed transition event of an infusion pump between primary and secondary operational modes, or when it is manually paused and then restarted;

• Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that track a patient’s progress by monitoring, among other events, ventilator transitions from the primary operational mode to a backup mode (e.g., patient triggered to fully mechanical breaths);

• Clinical information systems that note an event when a patient’s physiological monitor is placed into Standby Mode;

• Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) records usage events and technical (non-alert) maintenance events to determine when a piece of equipment should be evaluated for proper operation.
____

In contrast to ORU^R42, the ORU^R01 message is typically used to periodically report “bulk” or full-disclosure device data that may include event information, albeit not reported in a timely manner and in a way that requires more processing to identify. As mentioned, the ORU^R40 message supports a class of episodic events, but focuses on those alerts and alarms that require some level of clinical response to resolve. The ORU^R42 message explicitly does not require clinical action to be taken in response to receipt of the message.

The OBX-8 field for these messages should be left blank or set to “N” for normal. Any abnormal or other non-normal indications should result in usage of the ORU^R40 message.

The ORU^R40 message is outside of the order-fulfilling cycle of the ORU and OUL messages with other trigger events, and is supplemental to those order-fulfilling observations. As such, the results conveyed in the ORU^R40 message do not replace, edit, or override the results of messages with other trigger events.

=== 7.3.15 ORU – Unsolicited Patient-Device Association Observation Message (Event R43)

The R43 trigger event is used for observation reports that indicate the association of one patient to one or more health care devices. This includes both patient-device association as well as disassociation when a device is removed from active use with a patient. Other messages may be utilized for this purpose (e.g., ADT); however, this message was chosen given the general use of ORU-style messages to communicate device data, including unique device identifiers (e.g., PRT-10 and UDI components), and the possible need to include additional device data such as hardware / software configuration. The R43 trigger provides indication of the specialized usage of this message. Note that OBX-3 Observation Identifier, PRT-4 Participation, and OBX-11 Observation Result Status represent the purpose of the association of the device and the status of that association as further defined through the appropriate implementation guides and/or profiles.

Use cases that this message supports include:

____
• Simple patient-device association where a system that integrates a bar code or RFID reader is used to capture patient and device identifiers at the point of care and then communicate those to other devices and systems that process device data associated with the same patient.

• When one or more devices are no longer associated with a patient, this message can be used to communicate this change of status

• Systems may not only perform the identifier acquisition from patients and devices, but may also authenticate the identifiers and support cross-referencing (e.g., when there are multiple patient identifiers)
____

In the latter use case, this message can be used to establish a “source of truth” for patient-device associations. There are many systems in and supportive of the point of care that make associations between patients and health care devices, all of which need to be coordinated to ensure there are no mis-matches between information sources and the patients to which they are associated.

The message shall identify a patient with optional location information, and one or more device observations, each including a unique device identifier along with an indication of whether the device is being associated or disassociated with the specified patient. In addition, a single observation can be specified to disassociate all devices for a given patient.

== 7.4 General Segments

The full definitions of many segments required for reporting clinical observations are included in other chapters. The patient identifying segment (PID) is provided in Chapter 3. The NTE segment is in Chapter 2.

=== 7.4.1 OBR – Observation Request Segment 

General (taken from ASTM E1238)

The Observation Request (OBR) segment is used to transmit information specific to an order for a diagnostic study or observation, physical exam, or assessment.

The Observation Request segment defines the attributes of a particular request for diagnostic services (e.g., laboratory, EKG) or clinical observations (e.g., vital signs or physical exam). When a placer requests a given set of observations, always include an order segment. For lab tests, the information in the order segment usually applies to a single specimen. However, there is not a one-to-one relationship between specimen and tests ordered. Different test batteries will usually require their own order segments even when they can be performed on a single specimen. In this case, the specimen information must be duplicated in each of the order segments that employ that specimen. For other diagnostic studies, e.g., chest X-ray, a separate order segment will usually be generated for each diagnostic study.

Though multiple observation batteries can be ordered on a single order segment, the observation filler shall generate a separate order segment for each battery that it processes independently, e.g., electrolyte, CBC, vital signs. When reporting the observations, the filling service shall copy the appropriate order (specimen) information from the original order segment into each of the new order segments so that a separate "order" segment is returned to the placer as a "header" for each separate battery of observations.

In the event that an ordered battery of observations cannot be performed, e.g., because of hemolysis on a blood sample, an order segment will be returned to the placer with _OBR-25-result status_ equal to X (to indicate that the study was not performed). In this case, no observation segments will be transmitted.

When observations are successfully completed, the message returned to the placer will include the order segment (OBR) followed by observation (OBX) segments for each distinct observation generated by the order (see Chapter 7). The number of such observation segments will depend upon the number of individual measurements performed in the process.

OBX segments can be sent by the placer along with an order to provide the filling service with clinical data needed to interpret the results. (See Chapter 7 for OBX details.)

==== 7.4.1.0 OBR field definitions

The daggered (+) items in this segment are created by the filler, not the placer. They are valued by the filler as needed when the OBR segment is returned as part of a report.

The starred (*) fields are only relevant when an observation is associated with a specimen. These are completed by the placer when the placer obtains the specimen. They are completed by the filler when the filler obtains the specimen.

_OBR-7-observation date/time_ and _OBR-8-observation end date/time_ (flagged with #) are the physiologically relevant times. In the case of an observation on a specimen, they represent the start and end of the specimen collection. In the case of an observation obtained directly from a subject (e.g., BP, Chest X-ray), they represent the start and end time of the observation.

==== 7.4.1.1 OBR-1 Set ID – OBR (SI) 00237

Definition: For the first order transmitted, the sequence number shall be 1; for the second order, it shall be 2; and so on.

==== 7.4.1.2 OBR-2 Placer order number (EI) 00216

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field is identical to _ORC-2-Placer Order Number_.

This field is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (Chapter 2A, section 2.A.28). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (section 2.A.36, "HD – Hierarchic designator"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.

See _ORC-2-placer order number_ (section *Error! Reference source not found.*) for information on when this field must be valued.

A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).

The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in _ORC-2_ and _OBR-2_ are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in _ORC-3_ and _OBR-3_ are logically the same thing: the filler id.

From that perspective, each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.

If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). If both segments contain either ORC-2/OBR-2 or ORC-3/OBR-3, then each pair must be a matching pair. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments.

It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated.

These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).

==== 7.4.1.3 OBR-3 Filler Order Number (EI) 00217

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field is the order number associated with the filling application. This is a permanent identifier for an order and its associated observations. It is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (see Chapter 2, section 2.A.28, "EI – entity identifier").

The first component is a string that identifies an individual order segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the order filling (receiving) application. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). This uniqueness must persist over time.

The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, "HD – hierarchic designator"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order.

See _ORC-3-filler order number_ for information on when this field must be valued.

The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in _ORC-2_ and _OBR-2_ are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in _ORC-3_ and _OBR-3_ are logically the same thing: the filler id.

From that perspective, each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.

If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). If both segments contain either ORC-2/OBR-2 or ORC-3/OBR-3, then each pair must be a matching pair. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments.

It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated.

The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.

Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with _ORC-1-order control_ equal to "CA" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.

==== 7.4.1.4 OBR-4 Universal Service Identifier (CWE) 00238

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains the identifier code for the requested observation/test/battery. The identifier can come from either a local coding system or industry standards. Examples may be LOINC (emerging as the global standard for observation identifiers), JLAC10, or SNOMED CT. Refer to Table 0612 - Universal Service Identifier in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 7.4.1.6 OBR-6 Requested Date/Time

*Attention: _The OBR-6 element was retained for backward compatibility only as of v 2.4 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7._*

==== 7.4.1.7 OBR-7 Observation Date/Time (DTM) 00241

Definition: This field is the clinically relevant date/time of the observation. In the case of observations taken directly from a subject, it is the actual date and time the observation was obtained. In the case of a specimen‑associated study, this field shall represent the date and time the specimen was collected or obtained. (This is a results-only field except when the placer or a third party has already drawn the specimen.) This field is conditionally required. When the OBR is transmitted as part of a report message, the field *must* be filled in. If it is transmitted as part of a request *and* a sample has been sent along as part of the request, this field must be filled in because this specimen time is the physiologically relevant date/time of the observation.

==== 7.4.1.8 OBR-8 Observation End Date/Time (DTM) 00242

Definition: This field contains the end date and time of a study or timed specimen collection. If an observation takes place over a substantial period of time, it will indicate when the observation period ended. For observations made at a point in time, it will be null. This is a results field except when the placer or a party other than the filler has already drawn the specimen.

Definition: This field specifies the date/time when the results were reported or status changed. This conditional field is required whenever the OBR-25 is valued. This field is used to indicate the date and time that the results are composed into a report and released, or that a status, as defined in _ORC-5 order status_, is entered or changed. (This is a results field only.) When other applications (such as office or clinical database applications) query the laboratory application for un-transmitted results, the information in this field may be used to control processing on the communications link. Usually, the ordering service would want only those results for which the reporting date/time is greater than the date/time the inquiring application last received results.

Refer to link:#obx-observationresult-segment[_HL7 Table 0074 – Diagnostic Service Section ID_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries.

==== 7.4.1.25 OBR-25 Result Status (ID) 00258

Definition: This field contains the status of results for this order. This conditional field is required whenever the OBR is contained in a report message. It is not required as part of an initial order.

There are two methods of sending status information. If the status is that of the entire order, use _ORC-15-order effective date/time_ and _ORC-5-order status_. If the status pertains to the order detail segment, use _OBR-25-result status_ and _OBR-22-results rpt/status chng – date/time_. If both are present, the OBR values override the ORC values.

This field would typically be used in a response to an order status query where the level of detail requested does not include the OBX segments. When the individual status of each result is necessary, _OBX-11-observ result status_ may be used. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70123[_HL7 Table 0123 – Result Status_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries.

Subcomponents for Parent Observation Sub-identifier (OG): <Original Sub-Identifier (ST)> & <Group (NM)> & <Sequence (NM)> & <Identifier (ST)>

Definition: This field is defined to make it available for other types of linkages (e.g., toxicology). This important information, together with the information in _OBR-29-Parent Result Obersvation Identifier_ and _OBR-54 Parent Order,_ uniquely identifies the parent result's OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports, or the specific result for which this order or observation is a reflex. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result which identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization. In the case of a reflex order, if it is necessary to point to the specific result value for which it is in response, OBR-26 enables pointing to that specific OBX segment.

The third component may be used to record the name of the microorganism identified by the parent result directly. The organism in this case should be identified exactly as it is in the parent culture.

We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.

This field is present only when the parent result is identified by _OBR-29-_ Result Observation Identifier or OBR-54, Parent Order__,__ and the parent spawns child orders or results for each of many results. (See Chapter 7 for more details about this linkage.)

A second mode of conveying this information is to use a standard observation result segment (OBX). If more than one organism is present, _OBX-4-observation sub-ID_ is used to distinguish them. In this case, the first OBX with subID N will contain a value identifying the Nth microorganism, and each additional OBX with subID N will contain susceptibility values for a given antimicrobial test on this organism.

=== 7.4.2 OBX ‑ Observation/Result Segment

The OBX segment is used to transmit a single observation or observation fragment. It represents the smallest indivisible unit of a report. The OBX segment can also contain encapsulated data, e.g., a CDA document or a DICOM image.

Its principal mission is to carry information about observations in report messages. But the OBX can also be part of an observation order (see Chapter 4, section 4.4, "General Trigger Events & Message Definitions"). In this case, the OBX carries clinical information needed by the filler to interpret the observation the filler makes. For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab. Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of the pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result. OBX is also found in other HL7 messages that need to include patient clinical information.

Definition: This field contains the sequence number. For compatibility with ASTM.

==== 7.4.2.2 OBX-2 Value Type (ID) 00570

____
Definition: This field defines the data type of OBX-5, Observation Value. If OBX-5, Observation Value, is valued then OBX-2, Value Type, SHALL be valued. When OBX-5, Observation Value, is not valued, OBX-2 Value Type MAY be valued to represent a data type used to value the observation expressed in OBX-3, Observation Identifier. See https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmcmail.mayo.edu%2Fowa%2FUrlBlockedError.aspx&data=02%7C01%7CHans.Buitendijk%40Cerner.com%7C94563515a95347b47e2a08d56ca7de79%7C0ffca1dc22de4c19b786f0dbf79a3c2e%7C0%7C0%7C636534390612534684&sdata=98cL%2B7xxtWw9ruy81%2FrxSZUwPIHr2uRIsEX2zsmJT%2BI%3D&reserved=0[_HL7 Table 0125 – Value Types_] for valid values.

Condition: This field is required if OBX-5, Observation Value, is valued.
____

For example, if the value is 'CWE' then the result in OBX-5 must be a coded entry or text or both. As of v 2.7, the ST data type may not be used to transmit data that can be more precisely transmitted using other data types, e.g. SN when comparative symbols are needed.

The RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the OBX-5 contains a pointer to the data e.g., a URL of an image. The receiving system can use this reference pointer whenever it needs access to the actual data through other interface standards, e.g., DICOM, or through appropriate data base servers.

The structured numeric (SN) data type provides for reporting ranges (e.g., 3-5 or 10-20), titres (e.g., 1:10), and out-of-range indicators (e.g., >50) in a structured and computer-interpretable way.

We allow the FT data type in the OBX segment, but its use is discouraged. Formatted text usually implies a meaningful structure, e.g., a list of three independent diagnoses reported on different lines. But ideally, the structure in three independent diagnostic statements would be reported as three separate OBX segments.

TX should *not* be used except to send large amounts of text. In the TX data type, the repeat delimiter can only be used to identify paragraph breaks. Use ST to send short, and possibly encodable, text strings.

CDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment in any message that can exchange documents (such as MDM or ORU). Within the OBX segment, the MIME package is encoded as an encapsulated (ED) data type.

==== 7.4.2.3 OBX-3 Observation Identifier (CWE) 00571

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains a unique identifier for the observation. The format is that of the Coded Element (CWE). Example: "8625-6^P-R interval^LN". Refer to Table 0622 - Observation Identifier in Chapter 2C for valid values.

In most systems the identifier will *point* to a master observation table that will provide other attributes of the observation that may be used by the receiving system to process the observations it receives. A set of message segments for transmitting such master observation tables is described in Chapter 8. The relation of an observation ID to a master observation table is analogous to the relationship between a charge code (in a billing record) and the charge master.

When local codes are used as the first identifier in this field we strongly encourage sending a universal identifier as well to permit receivers to equivalence results from different providers of the same service (e.g., a hospital lab and commercial lab that provides serum potassium to a nursing home). LOINC® is one possible universal and HL7-approved code system for the Observation identifier. It covers observations and measurements, such as laboratory tests, physical findings, radiology studies, and claims attachments. See file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[_HL7 Table 0396 – Coding System_], the HL7 www list server and Appendix X2 of ASTM E1467 for neurophysiology tests, or it can be obtained from http://www.regenstrief.org/loinc/loinc.htm[www.regenstrief.org/loinc/loinc.htm].

*The use of suffixes as described in section _7.2.4_ and section _7.2.5_ has been deprecated as of v 2.7.*

==== 7.4.2.4 OBX-4 Observation Sub‑ID (OG) 00572

Components: <Original Sub-Identifier (ST)> ^ <Group (NM)> ^ <Sequence (NM)> ^ <Identifier (ST)>

Definition: This field is used to distinguish between multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID organized under one OBR. Starting with V2.8.2 the data type was changed from ST to OG to enable improved structured grouping of observation segments. In this enhanced mode, the first component provides backwards compatibility with existing grouping schemes, while the additional components can be used for improved structures as defined in specific conformance profiles. For example, a chest X-ray report might include three separate diagnostic impressions. The standard requires three OBX segments, one for each impression. By putting a 1 in the Sub-ID of the first of these OBX segments, 2 in the second, and 3 in the third, we can uniquely identify each OBX segment for editing or replacement.

The sub-identifier is also used to group related components in reports such as surgical pathology. It is traditional for surgical pathology reports to include all the tissues taken from one surgical procedure in one report. Consider, for example, a single surgical pathology report that describes the examination of gallbladder and appendix tissue. This report would be transmitted roughly as shown in Figure 7-2.

The example in Figure 7-2 has two segments for each component of the report, one for each of the two tissues. Thus, there are two "31208-2^Specimen source [Identifier] of Unspecified specimen^LN" segments; there are two "22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN" segments, and there are two "22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN" segments. Segments that apply to the gallbladder all have the sub-identifier 1. Segments that apply to the appendix all have sub-identifier 2.

The observation sub ID has other grouping uses. It can be used to organize the reporting of some kinds of fluid intakes and outputs. For example, when intake occurs through multiple intravenous lines, a number of separate observations (OBX segments), the intake volume, the type of intake (Blood, D5W, Plasma, etc.), the site of the IV line, etc. may be needed for each intravenous line, each requiring a separate OBX segment. If more than one IV line is running, we can logically link all of the OBX segments that pertain to the first IV line by assigning them an observation sub ID of 1. We can do the same with the second IV line by assigning them a sub ID 2 and so on. The same would apply to the outputs of surgical drains when there are multiple such drains.

The use of the sub ID to distinguish repeating OBXs for the same observation ID is really a special case of using the sub ID to group, as can be seen if we picture the OBX segments in Figure 7-2 as part of a table where the rows correspond to a particular species of observation and the cells correspond to the sub ID numbers that would be associated with each corresponding OBX.

The use of Sub IDs to group results is equivalent to defining a table, and the use of sub IDs to distinguish repeats is just a special case, represented by one column in this table.

However, this approach introduces ambiguities if we have a set of repeating observations within a group, e.g., if the appendix observations include two impressions as in the 8th and 9th OBXs shown in Figure 7-3. This really represents the existence of a row nested within a single cell of the table given above.

The text under _OBX-5-observation value_ provides guidance about dealing with two OBXs with the same observation ID and observation sub IDs. They are sent and replaced as a unit. However, some systems will take this to mean that the set of OBXs is to be combined into one composite observation in the receiving system. In original mode, this could use a dot and a string (similar to the Dewey Decimal system) notation that would be used when users wish to distinguish each of the repeats within one type, or results within a cell for editing and correction purposes. Using this system, Figure 7-3 would become 7-4. If there are cases where such nesting occurs at even deeper levels, this approach could be extended, although with the introduction of the OG data type we suggest the use of components 2-4 as described in Figure 7-2.

Use a null or 1 when there is no need for multiples.

If the observation includes a number of OBXs with the same value for the observation ID OBX-3, then one must use different values for the sub-ID. If there is no need to group or sequence any further, the original mode can continue to be used to ensure uniqueness of OBX as shown in the example below of an electrocardiograph chest radiograph report with three diagnostic impressions, using 1,2,3 in the sub-ID field to distinguish the three separate results.

==== 7.4.2.5 OBX-5 Observation Value (varies) 00573

Definition: This field contains the value observed by the observation producer. _OBX-2-value type_ contains the data type for this field according to which observation value is formatted. It is not a required field because some systems will report only the Interpretation Codes (_OBX-8_), especially in product experience reporting. The length of the observation field is variable, depending upon _OBX-2-value type_. This field may repeat for multipart, single answer results.

Representation

This field contains the value related to the _OBX-3-observation identifier_ of the same segment. Depending upon the observation, the data type may be a number (e.g., a respiratory rate), a coded answer (e.g., a pathology impression recorded as SNOMED), or a date/time (the date/time that a unit of blood is sent to the ward). An observation value is always represented as the data type specified in _OBX-2-value type_ of the same segment. Whether numeric or short text, the answer shall be recorded in ASCII text.

Reporting logically independent observations

The main sections of dictated reports, such as radiologic studies or history and physicals, are reported as separate OBX segments. In addition, each logically independent observation should be reported in a separate OBX segment, i.e., one OBX segment should not contain the *result* of more than one logically independent observation, unless it is part of a list of like concepts that belong together (e.g., a list of conditions tested for in newborn screening or mutations looked for in genomic testing). This requirement is included to assure that the contents of _OBX-6-units_, _OBX-8-interpretation codes_, and _OBX-9-probability_ can be interpreted unambiguously. This means that all other OBX field values apply equally to the whole of OBX-5 noting that OBX-6 does not apply in the case of coded values. The electrolytes and vital signs batteries, for example, would each be reported as four separate OBX segments. Two diagnostic impressions, e.g., congestive heart failure and pneumonia, would also be reported as two separate OBX segments whether reported as part of a discharge summary or chest X-ray report. Similarly, two bacterial organisms isolated in a single bacterial culture would be reported as two separate OBX segments.

Though two independent diagnostic *statements* cannot be reported in one OBX segment, unless they represent elements of a single list to which all other OBX field values apply equally, multiple categorical responses are allowed (usually as CWE data types separated by repeat delimiters), so long as they are fragments (modifiers) that together construct one diagnostic statement. Right upper lobe (recorded as one code) and pneumonia (recorded as another code), for example, could be both reported in one OBX segment. Such multiple "values" would be separated by repeat delimiters. The other example where use of repeat delimiters is allowed for coded values would be a list of conditions or mutations tested for to provide reference for the test results reported in related, but independent OBX segments. Multiple answers to a single question (for example mark all that apply type questions) could also be handled using this approach. It is important to state that ANY independent observation, that may require parent-child linking to additional tests, such as reflex testing, SHALL NOT be included in a single OBX-5 field using repeat delimiters, nor any list elements that require variations in the values of other OBX field values.

The following provides an example of how this may be communicated for 10 Cystic Fibrosis mutations, where the mutations are highlighted in red font (note that some labs test for as many as 140 mutations):

OBX|1|CWE|21656-4^CFTR gene mutations tested for in Blood or Tissue by Molecular genetics method Nominal ^LN|1|c.254G>A^^HGVS~c.350G>A^^HGVS~c.489+1G>T^^HGVS~c.579+1G>T^^HGVS~c.1000C>T^^HGVS~c.1040G>C^^HGVS~c.1364C>A^^HGVS~c.1519_1521del^^HGVS~c.1521_1523del^^HGVS~c.1585-1G>A^^HGVS|||N|||F

Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and Sub ID

In some systems, a single observation may include *fragments* of more than one data type. The most common example is a numeric result followed by coded comments (CWE). In this case, the logical observation can be sent in more than one OBX segment. For example, one segment of numeric data type for the numeric result and another segment of CWE data type for coded comments. If the producer was reporting multiple coded comments they would all be sent in one OBX segment separated by repeat delimiters because they all modified a single logical observation. Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID should always be sent in sequence with the most significant OBX segment (the one that has the normal flag/units and or reference range and status flag) first. The value of _OBX-6 through 12_ should be null in any following OBX segments with the same _OBX-3-observation identifier_ and _OBX-4-observation sub-ID_. For the purpose of replacement or deletion, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID are treated as a unit. If any are replaced or deleted, they all are replaced.

Coded values

When an OBX segment contains values of CWE data types, the observations are stored as a combination of codes and/or text. In Section _7.8.3_, "_CSS - Clinical Study Data Schedule Segment_," examples of results that are represented as CWE data types are shown in the first and second OBX segments of OBR 1 and the first and second OBX segments of OBR 2. The observation may be an observation battery ID (for recommended studies), a diagnostic code or finding (for a diagnostic impression), or an anatomic site for a pathology report, or any of the other kinds of coded results.

It is not necessary to always encode the information stored within a coded observation. For example, a chest X-ray impression could be transmitted as pure text even though it has a CWE data type. In this case, the test must be recorded as the second component of the *result code,* e.g.,

OBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.|...<cr>

However, separate impressions, recommendations, etc., even if recorded as pure text, should be recorded in separate result segments. That is, congestive heart failure and pneumonia should not be sent as:

OBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE AND PNEUMONIA|...<cr>

but as:

OBX|1|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|1|^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE|...<cr>

OBX|2|CWE|19005^X-Ray Impression^LN|2|^PNEUMONIA|....<cr>

Even better would be fully-coded results that include computer understandable codes (component 1) instead of, or in addition to, the text description (component 2). One may include multiple values in a CWE value and these can be mixtures of code and text, but only when they are needed to construct one diagnosis, impression, or concept. When text follows codes as an independent value it would be taken as a modifier or addenda to the codes. E.g.,

OBX|1|CWE|19005-8^X-ray impression^LN~29548-5^DiagnosisImpPatient^LN |1|428.0^CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE^I9C~^MASSIVE HEART|...<cr>

The text in component 2 should be an accurate description of the code in component 1. Likewise, if used, the text in component 5 should be an accurate description of the code in component 4.

Insertion of CDA within an OBX:

CDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment. The value of _OBX-2-Value Type_ should be set to 'ED'. _OBX-5-Observation Value_ contains the MIME package encoded as an encapsulated data type. The components should be valued as follows:

• Set the value of _OBX-5.2-Type of Data_ to 'multipart.'

• Set the value of _OBX-5.3-Data Subtype_ to '-hl7-cda-level-one.'

• Set the value of _OBX-5.4-Encoding_ to 'A'. (Note that a MIME package is not itself Base64-encoded. Rather entities within the MIME package are Base64-encoded. A MIME package is sent as ASCII text. Therefore, the correct value is 'A' not 'Base64.'

• Set the value of _OBX-5.5-Data_ to equal the MIME package. Every entity within the MIME package must be Base64-encoded. As stated in Chapter 2, "the data component must be scanned before transmission for HL7 delimiter characters (and other non-printing ASCII or non-ASCII characters such as LineFeed), and any found must be escaped by using the HL7 escape sequences defined in Section 2.7 'Use of escape sequences in text fields.' On the receiving application, the data field must be de-escaped after being parsed." As a result, CR/LF sequences required in the MIME package need to be escaped (i.e., converted to '\X0D0A\') prior to transmission. The content type of the first MIME entity is set to 'application/x-hl7-cda-level-one+xml', and should contain the CDA document itself. Multimedia objects referenced by the CDA document that need to be transmitted within the CDA document are to be placed in successive entities of the MIME package.

Definition: This field contains the units of measurement for the value in _OBX-5, Observation Value_. Coding system from which the values may be drawn include, UCUM, ISO+, ANSI X3.50 - 1986 and site specific (local) coding systems. Considering Version 3 direction and consistent use of V2 and V3 messages/documents within an organization, use of UCUM is strongly recommended. Refer to Table 0623 - Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Note that OBX-6 applies to both OBX-5.2 and OBX-5.4 if OBX-2 = “SN”.

==== 7.4.2.7 OBX-7 Reference Range (ST) 00575 

Components: for numeric values in the format:

{empty}a) lower limit-upper limit (when both lower and upper limits are defined, e.g., for potassium 3.5 - 4.5)

{empty}b) > lower limit (if no upper limit, e.g., >10)

{empty}c) < upper limit (if no lower limit, e.g., <15)

alphabetical values: the normal value may be reported in this location

Definition: When the observation quantifies the amount of a toxic substance, then the upper limit of the range identifies the toxic limit. If the observation quantifies a drug, the lower limits identify the lower therapeutic bounds and the upper limits represent the upper therapeutic bounds above which toxic side effects are common.

Definition: One or more codes specifying a categorical assessment of the observation value (OBX.5), such as "Normal", "Abnormal", "Positive", "Negative", "Resistant", "Susceptible", etc.

This field may also be used to convey an assessment of an observation where no legitimate result may be obtained. This includes laboratory assays that are rejected due to the presence of interfering substances, specimen toxicity or failure of quality control.

As a CWE data type, this field may be populated with either HL7-defined codes or codes derived from other code systems (such as SNOMED). See file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70078[_User-defined Table 0078 – Interpretation Code_] for potential entries.

When the filler can discern the normal status of a textual report, such as chest X-ray reports or microbiologic culture, these should be reported as "N" when normal and "A"when abnormal. Multiple codes, e.g., abnormal and worse, would be separated by a repeat delimiter, e.g., "A~W".

Results may also be reported in *shorthand* by reporting the normalcy status without specifying the exact numeric value of the result. Such shorthand is quite common in clinical notes, where physicians will simply say that *the glucose result was normal.* Such shorthand reporting is also seen in drug experience reporting. In such cases, the result can be reported in the OBX by reporting the interpretation code in _OBX-8-Interpretation Codes_ without specifying any value in _OBX-5-observation value._

==== 7.4.2.9 OBX-9 Probability (NM) 00577

Definition: This field contains the probability of a result being true for results with categorical values. It mainly applies to discrete coded results. It is a decimal number represented as an ASCII string that must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.

==== 7.4.2.10 OBX-10 Nature of abnormal test (ID) 00578

Definition: This field contains the nature of the abnormal test. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70080[_HL7 Table 0080 - Nature of abnormal testing_] for valid values. As many of the codes as apply may be included, separated by repeat delimiters. For example, normal values based on age, sex, and race would be codes as "A~S~R".

The constraints on the use of the codes in this table must be consistent with those defined in the PID segment, specifically _PID-35-Species Code_, _PID-36-Breed Code_ and _PID-37-Strain_.

==== 7.4.2.11 OBX-11 Observation Result Status (ID) 00579

Definition: This field contains the observation result status. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70085[_HL7 table 0085 - Observation result status codes interpretation_] for valid values. This field reflects the current completion status of the results for one Observation Identifier.

It is a required field. Previous versions of HL7 stated this implicitly by defining a default value of "F." Code *F* indicates that the result has been verified to be correct and final. Code *W* indicates that the result has been verified to be wrong (incorrect); a replacement (corrected) result may be transmitted later. Code *C* indicates that data contained in the _OBX-5-observation value_ field are to replace previously transmitted (verified and) final result data with the same observation ID (including suffix, if applicable) and observation sub-ID usually because the previous results were wrong. Code *D* indicates that data previously transmitted in a result segment with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID should be deleted. When changing or deleting a result, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and observation sub-ID are replaced or deleted as a unit. Normal progression of results through intermediate (e.g., 'gram positive cocci') to final (e.g., 'staphylococcus aureus') should not be transmitted as *C* (correction); they should be transmitted as *P* (depending upon the specific case) until they are final.

If an observation involves multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID, the observation result status applies to all OBX segments, except where the value is D or X. The value of D or X is applicable only to the individual OBX. All other OBX segments with the same Observation ID and observation sub-ID must have the same value.

In the case of coding systems such as LOINC, the preceding rules typically mean that this field applies to a single OBX segment.

There are situations where the observation battery required for the order needs to be dynamically specified at the time of ordering. That is, this battery is then defined by the set of OBX segments transmitted along with the order and generated by the placing system. For example, timed measurements of serum glucose challenge tests may vary among laboratories. One institution may report them at –30, -15, 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes, while another may report them at –30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Master file entries may exist for each individual element of the battery but not for the battery itself. Another example may be Renin Studies where the specification may be done upon ordering without having a master file definition for each permutation of the possible element. The OBX segments in the ORM message can be used to create dynamic specifications to accommodate these permutations without defining pre-existing master file definitions for the battery itself. The result status field in the OBX can be used to indicate whether the OBX in the ORM message is used to provide a dynamic specification or is used to communicate a result as context to the order. The status of O shall be used to indicate that the OBX segment is used for a dynamic specification of the required result. An OBX used for a dynamic specification must contain the detailed examination code, units, etc., with _OBX-11_ valued with O, and _OBX-2_ and _OBX-5_ valued with null.

==== 7.4.2.12 OBX-12 Effective Date of Reference Range (DTM) 00580 

Definition: This field contains the date (and, optionally, the time) on which the values in _OBX-7-reference range_ went into effect.

Usage Rule: This field can be valued only if _OBX-7-reference range_ is populated.

When this field is present, it facilitates comparison between identical results with different reference ranges. Reference range values may vary because of changes in laboratory practice over time. Such variances could reflect updated practice in laboratory medicine, or the use of updated instrumentation.

==== 7.4.2.13 OBX-13 User Defined Access Checks (ST) 00581

Definition: This field permits the producer to record results-dependent codes for classifying the observation at the receiving system. This field should be needed only rarely, because most classifications are fixed attributes of the observation ID and can be defined in the associated observation master file (see description in Chapter 8).

However, there are a few cases when such controls vary with the value of the observation in a complex way that the receiving system would not want to re‑calculate. An example is an antimicrobial susceptibility result. Some systems prefer to display only the susceptibility results of inexpensive antimicrobials depending upon the organism, the source of the specimen and the patient's allergy status. The sending service wants to send all of the susceptibilities so that certain privileged users (e.g., Infectious Disease specialists) can review all of the results but non-privileged users would see only the "preferred" antimicrobials to which the organism was susceptible. We expect that other cases also occur.

==== 7.4.2.14 OBX-14 Date/Time of the Observation (DTM) 00582

Definition: This field is needed in two circumstances. The first is when the observations reported beneath one report header (OBR) have different dates/times. This could occur in the case of queries, timed test sequences, or clearance studies where one measurement within a battery may have a different time than another measurement.

It is also needed in the case of OBX segments that are being sent by the placer to the filler, in which case the date of the observation being transmitted is likely to have no relation to the date of the requested observation. In France, requesting services routinely send a set of the last observations along with the request for a new set of observations. The date of these observations is important to the filler laboratories.

In all cases, the observation date-time is the physiologically relevant date-time or the closest approximation to that date-time. In the case of tests performed on specimens, the relevant date-time is the specimen's collection date-time. In the case of observations taken directly on the patient (e.g., X-ray images, history and physical), the observation date-time is the date-time that the observation was performed.

The Date/Time of observation can be used to identify when the answer was determined, i.e., when the answer to an Ask at Order Entry question was acquired.

Definition: *_Retained for backwards compatibility as of v 2.7 only. This field is now represented through the PRT segment._* This field contains a unique identifier of the responsible producing service. It should be reported explicitly when the test results are produced at outside laboratories, for example. When this field is null, the receiving system assumes that the observations were produced by the sending organization. This information supports CLIA regulations in the US. The code for producer ID is recorded as a CWE data type. In the US, the Medicare number of the producing service is suggested as the identifier.

Definition: *_Retained for backwards compatibility as of v 2.7 only. This field is now represented through the PRT segment._* When required, this field contains the identifier of the individual directly responsible for the observation (i.e., the person who either performed or verified it). In a nursing service, the observer is usually the professional who performed the observation (e.g., took the blood pressure). In a laboratory, the observer is the technician who performed or verified the analysis. The code for the observer is recorded as a CWE data type. If the code is sent as a local code, it should be unique and unambiguous when combined with _OBX-15-producer ID_.

This optional field can be used to transmit the method or procedure by which an observation was obtained when the sending system wishes to distinguish among one measurement obtained by different methods and the distinction is not implicit in the test ID. Chemistry laboratories do not usually distinguish between two different methods used to measure a given serum constituent (e.g., serum potassium) as part of the test name.

==== 7.4.2.18 OBX-18 Equipment Instance Identifier (EI) 01479 

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: *_Retained for backwards compatibility as of v 2.7 only. This field is now represented through the PRT segment._* This field identifies the Equipment Instance (e.g., Analyzer, Analyzer module, group of Analyzers, etc.) responsible for the production of the observation. This is the identifier from an institution's master list of equipment, where the institution is specified by the _namespace ID_ or if it is blank, then by the "Producer's ID" (OBX-15). It should be possible to retrieve from this master list the equipment type, serial number, etc., however it is not planned to transfer this information with every OBX. The repeating of this field allows for the hierarchical representation of the equipment (lowest level first), e.g., module of an instrument, instrument consisting of modules, cluster of multiple instruments, etc.

==== 7.4.2.19 OBX-19 Date/Time of the Analysis (DTM) 01480

Definition: This field is used to transfer the time stamp associated with generation of the analytical result by the instrument specified in Equipment Instance Identifier (see above).

Definition: This field typically contains the body site(s) where the measurement being reported was obtained. This field should not be used for a specimen source or specimen collection site.

This information is of particular importance if the clinical meaning of a value is modified either directly by the site (for example, is the temperature central or peripheral?) or if the site of one measurement impacts the value of another measurement (for example, is the finger SpO2 probe on the same arm as the NIBP cuff?). In most cases these observations are performed directly upon the patient and do not involve a specimen.

Any nationally recognized coding system might be used for this field including SNOMED or MDC; alternatively the file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70163[_HL7 Table 0163 – Body Site_] may be used. Veterinary medicine may choose the tables supported for the components of this field as decided by their industry.

==== 7.4.2.21 OBX-21 Observation Instance Identifier (EI) 02180

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains a unique identifier for this observation. This instance identifier is persistent between messages.

Note: OBX-21 Observation Instance Identifier was introduced in v 2.6 to support Patient Care messaging concepts and constructs. At this time, there are no documented use cases for this field in the context of messages as described in this chapter. This statement does not preclude the use of OBX-21, but implementers should exercise caution in using this field outside of the Patient Care context until the appropriate use cases are established. This identifier provides persistent reference to an object within or outside the message and represents an identifier established by external applications rather than temporal message considerations.

Definition: This field identifies the actuality of the observation (e.g., intent, request, promise, event). Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70725[HL7 Table 0725 – Mood Codes] for valid values. This field may only be used with new trigger events and new messages from v 2.6 onward. When this field is not valued in a message that qualifies, then the Value is assumed to be 'EVN'.

Note: OBX-22 Mood Code was introduced in v 2.6 to support Patient Care messaging concepts and constructs. At this time, there are no documented use cases for this field in the context messages as described in this chapter. This statement does not preclude the use of OBX-22, but implementers should exercise caution in using this field outside of the Patient Care context until appropriate use cases are established. While a similar note exists for OBX-21 Observation Instance Identifier, particular care should be taken with OBX-22 as this could modify the intent of the segment/message and create backward compatibility problems.

Definition: *_Retained for backwards compatibility as of v 2.7 only. This field is now represented through the PRT segment._* This field contains the name of the organization/service responsible for performing the service. When this field is null, the receiving system assumes that the observations were produced by the sending organization. The information for performing organization is recorded as an XON data type. In the US, the Medicare number of the performing organization is suggested as the identifier (component 10).

For lab, this field specifies the laboratory that produced the test result described in this OBX segment. It should be reported explicitly when the test results are produced at outside laboratories, for example. This information supports CLIA regulations in the US.

Subcomponents for Placer Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Subcomponents for Filler Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains the unique identifier for the specimen as referenced by the Placer application, the Filler application, or both in the SPM segment that describes the specimen this observation is related to, allowing an explicit linkage between the two.

=== 7.4.3 SPM – Specimen Segment

The intent of this segment is to describe the characteristics of a specimen. It differs from the intent of the OBR in that the OBR addresses order-specific information. It differs from the SAC segment in that the SAC addresses specimen container attributes. An advantage afforded by a separate specimen segment is that it generalizes the multiple relationships among order(s), results, specimen(s) and specimen container(s).

A specimen is defined as "A physical entity that is an individual, a group, an item, or a part representative of a larger group, class or whole that is the target of an observation or analysis for the purpose of drawing conclusions about the group, class, or whole." Note that any physical entity in the universe has the potential to become a specimen

A specimen is collected or obtained from a source and may be representative of the source, or may represent a deviation within the source. A specimen may be wholly or partially consumed during an observation and any remaining portion of the specimen is persistent and can be stored.

This segment may also be used in limited cases to describe a "virtual" specimen. In particular, to identify the characteristics required for a specimen in the context of a specific observation or test.

In summary, SPM represents the attributes specific and unique to a specimen.

==== 7.4.3.0 SPM field definitions

==== 7.4.3.1 SPM -1 Set ID ‑ SPM (SI) 01754 

Definition: This field contains the sequence number. This field is used to identify SPM segment instances in message structures where the SPM segment repeats.

==== 7.4.3.2 SPM-2 Specimen Identifier (EIP) 01755 

Components: <Placer Assigned Identifier (EI)> ^ <Filler Assigned Identifier (EI)>

Subcomponents for Placer Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Subcomponents for Filler Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains a unique identifier for the specimen as referenced by the Placer application, the Filler application, or both.

This field is not required, as there are use cases in which a unique specimen identifier may not exist. In the first scenario, a placer application may initiate an observation request against an existing specimen without uniquely identifying the specimen. Additionally, in the case of the TCU_U10 message structure, used in Automated equipment test code settings messages, the SPM segment is used to define required characteristics of the specimen. As such, TCU_U10 uses SPM to define a virtual specimen, and a specific specimen identifier would not exist. Filler applications would be expected to assign a Specimen Identifier and populate this field accordingly.

==== 7.4.3.3 SPM-3 Specimen Parent IDs (EIP) 01756 

Components: <Placer Assigned Identifier (EI)> ^ <Filler Assigned Identifier (EI)>

Subcomponents for Placer Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Subcomponents for Filler Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains the identifiers for the specimen or specimens that contributed to the specimen that is described by the segment instance.

If this field repeats, then _SPM-11-Specimen Role_ should be valued with "L" (pooled). The repetitions of this field then carry the specimen IDs of the parent specimens contributing to the pool.

==== 7.4.3.4 SPM-4 Specimen Type (CWE) 01900 

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field describes the precise nature of the entity that will be the source material for the observation.

Any physical entity that may have observations made about it may qualify as a specimen. The entry in this attribute describes the specific entity as precisely as possible, whether that is a complex organism (e.g., an ostrich) or a specific cellular mass (e.g., a specific muscle biopsy).

A nationally recognized coding system is to be used for this field. Valid coding sources for this field include:

• file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70487[_HL7 Table 0487 – Specimen Type_] (replaces file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70070[_HL7 Table 0070 – Specimen source codes_])

• SNOMED, etc.

• Veterinary medicine may choose the tables supported for the components of this field as decided by their industry.

Definition: This field contains modifying or qualifying description(s) about the specimen type

The use of this attribute is to modify, qualify or further specify, the entity described by _SPM-4 -Specimen Type_. This is particularly useful when the code set used in _SPM-4-Specimen Type_ does not provide the precision required to fully describe the specimen. For example, if the specimen was precisely described as 'capillary venous blood' but the code set employed only provided 'venous blood,' this attribute could be employed to add the modifier 'capillary.'

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70541[_User-Defined Table 0541 Specimen Type Modifier_] for suggested values.

Definition: This field identifies any additives introduced to the specimen before or at the time of collection. These additives may be introduced in order to preserve, maintain or enhance the particular nature or component of the specimen. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70371[_HL7 Table 0371 – Additive/Preservative_] for valid values. When multiple additives are introduced and valid individual additive codes exist but a valid value for the combination does not exist, repeating the field with individual values is most appropriate.

Definition: This field contains modifying or qualifying description(s) about the specimen source site

The use of this attribute is to modify, qualify or further specify, the entity described by _SPM-8 – Specimen Source Site_. This is particularly useful when the code set used in _SPM-8_ does not provide the precision required to fully describe the site from which the specimen originated. For example, if the specimen source site was precisely described as 'left radial vein' but the code set employed only provided 'radial vein,' this attribute could be employed to add the modifier 'left.'

Veterinary medicine may choose the tables supported for the components of this field as decided by their industry.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70542[_User-Defined Table 0542 – Specimen Source Type Modifier_] for suggested values.

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field differs from _SPM-8-Specimen Source Site_ in those cases where the source site must be approached via a particular site (e.g., anatomic location). For example, in the case where a liver biopsy is obtained via a percutaneous needle, the collection site would be the point of entry of the needle. For venous blood collected from the left radial vein, the collection site could be "antecubital fossa".

Veterinary medicine may choose the tables supported for the components of this field as decided by their industry.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70543[_User-Defined Table 0543 – Specimen Collection Site_] for suggested values.

==== 7.4.3.11 SPM-11 Specimen Role (CWE) 01762

This field indicates the role of the sample. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70369[_User-defined Table 0369 – Specimen role_] for suggested values. Each of these values is normally identifiable by the systems and its components and can influence processing and data management related to the specimen.

If this field is not populated, then the specimen described has no special, or specific, role other than serving as the focus of the observation. Such specimens include patient, environmental and other specimens that are intended for analysis.

A grouped specimen consists of identical specimen types from multiple individuals that do not have individual identifiers and upon which the same services will be performed. If the specimen role value is "G" then the Grouped Specimen Count (_SPM-13_) must be valued with the total number of specimens contained in the group.

If the specimen role is "L", the repetitions of Parent Specimen ID (SPM-4) represent the individual parent specimens that contribute to the pooled specimen.

==== 7.4.3.12 SPM-12 Specimen Collection Amount (CQ) 01902 

Components: <Quantity (NM)> ^ <Units (CWE)>

Subcomponents for Units (CWE): <Identifier (ST)> & <Text (ST)> & <Name of Coding System (ID)> & <Alternate Identifier (ST)> & <Alternate Text (ST)> & <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> & <Coding System Version ID (ST)> & <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> & <Original Text (ST)> & <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> & <Second Alternate Text (ST)> & <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> & <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> & <Coding System OID (ST)> & <Value Set OID (ST)> & <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> & <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> & <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> & <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> & <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> & <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> & <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field specifies the volume or mass of the collected specimen. For laboratory tests, the collection volume is the volume of a specimen. Specifically, units should be expressed in the ISO Standard unit abbreviations (ISO‑2955, 1977). This is a results-only field except when the placer or a party has already drawn the specimen. Use of UCUM is strongly recommended as one of the delivered units (could be in addition to the local units). (See Chapter 7 Section 7.4.2.6 for a full discussion regarding units.)

==== 7.4.3.13 SPM-13 Grouped Specimen Count (NM) 01763 

Definition: This field refers to the number of individual specimens of a particular type represented by this instance of a specimen. The use of this field is restricted to specimens upon which all specimen related attributes are identical. This field would only be valued if SPM-11 Specimen Role has the value "G" or “L”.

==== 7.4.3.14 SPM-14 Specimen Description (ST) 01764 

Definition: This is a text field that allows additional information *specifically about the specimen* to be sent in the message

Definition: This describes how the specimen and/or container need to be handled from the time of collection through the initiation of testing. As this field is not required, no assumptions can be made as to meaning when this field is not populated.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70376[_User-defined Table 0376 – Special Handling Code_] for suggested values.

Definition: This field contains any known or suspected specimen hazards, e.g., exceptionally infectious agent or blood from a hepatitis patient. Either code and/or text may be absent. However, the code is always placed in the first component position and any free text in the second component. Thus, a component delimiter must precede free text without a code. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70489[_User-defined Table 0489 – Risk Codes_] for suggested entries

==== 7.4.3.17 SPM-17 Specimen Collection Date/Time (DR) 01765 

Components: <Range Start Date/Time (DTM)> ^ <Range End Date/Time (DTM)>

Definition: The date and time when the specimen was acquired from the source. The use of the Date Range data type allows for description of specimens collected over a period of time, for example, 24-hour urine collection. For specimens collected at a point in time, only the first component (start date/time) will be populated.

==== 7.4.3.18 SPM-18 Specimen Received Date/Time (DTM) 00248 

Definition: The specimen received date/time is the time that the specimen is received at the diagnostic service facility. The actual time that is recorded is based on how specimen receipt is managed and may correspond to the time the sample is logged in. This is fundamentally different from _SPM-17 Specimen Collection date/time_.

==== 7.4.3.19 SPM-19 Specimen Expiration Date/Time (DTM) 01904 

Definition: This field is the date and time the specimen can no longer be used for the purpose implied by the order. For example, in the Blood Banking environment the specimen can no longer be used for pre-transfusion compatibility testing. The specimen segment will include a _SPM-21-Specimen Reject Reason_ of 'EX' indicating 'Expired' for message instances created after this date and time.

==== 7.4.3.20 SPM-20 Specimen Availability (ID) 01766 

Definition: This describes whether the specimen, as it exists, is currently available to use in an analysis. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70136[_HL7 Table 0136 – Yes/No Indicator_] for valid values.

Definition: This field contains accession identifier(s) associated with the specimen. In many cases, applications involved in the collection, transportation or testing of the specimen will assign their own accession identifiers. This field allows communication of these accession identifiers.

An accession id may or may not, depending up laboratory practice, identify a single specimen. Best practice is to use accession identifiers that are globally unique (typically ID Number + Assigning Facility components). However, an accession id may or may not, depending up laboratory practice, identify a single specimen. In addition, accession ids are commonly re-used over time, so the accession id may not uniquely identify a specimen.

=== 7.4.4 PRT – Participation Information Segment

The Participation Information segment contains the data necessary to add, update, correct, and delete from the record persons, organizations, devices, or locations (participants) participating in the activity being transmitted.

In general, the PRT segment is used to describe a participant playing a particular role within the context of the message. In OO, for example, in the results messages the PRT segment may be used to provide the performing provider, whether a person or organization. In a specimen shipment message it may be the waypoint location relevant for the shipment.

The positional location of the PRT segment indicates the relationship. When the segment is used following the OBX segment, then the participations relate to that OBX addressing participations such as responsible observer.

The PRT segment may be used to communicate U.S. FDA Unique Device Identifier (UDIfootnote:[See http://www.fda.gov/udi[www.fda.gov/udi].]) information, with the PRT-10 field containing the UDI and additional fields added to contain UDI elements, when it is advised to communicate these individually (see Guidance in PRT-10 definition). These identifiers are intended to cover a wide variety of devices. When representing a UDI, PRT-4 would be “EQUIP”.

____

The identifier root shall be the OID assigned to UDI. For example, for FDA UDIs the root shall be 2.16.840.1.113883.3.3719, and the extension shall be the Human Readable Form appropriate for the style of content. When captured as a simple string, the string shall be the Human Readable Form appropriate for the style of content. The content style can be determined from the leading characters of the content:

____
UDIs beginning with:

‘(‘ are in the GS1 Human Readable style;

‘0-9’ are a GS1 DI (containing only the DI value, no PI or GS1 AI);

‘+‘ are in the HIBCC Human Readable style;

‘=‘ or ‘&’ are in the ICCBBA Human Readable style.

Note: If “&” is used in the UDI while one of the delimiters in MSH.2 includes “&” as well, it must be properly escaped per Chapter 2.7.
____

The exchange of UDI sub-elements in PRT-16 through PRT-21 is not required when the full UDI string is provided in PRT-10. Whether to include some or all these fields as well when PRT-10 is present with a UDI that the rules are subject to specific implementation guides that will have to consider the patient safety implications of potentially conflicting data.

When a UDI is provided and sub-elements are also provided, then for those sub-elements that are valued, the content must match the content encoded in the UDI if it is encoded within the UDI.

When communicating a UDI, the UDI may either be uniquely identifying an instance of a device, or a type of device. This can be asserted based on the inclusion or absence of a serial number in the Product Identifier section of the UDI. When the serial number is present, PRT-10 must be used, while if it is absent, PRT-22 must be used.

*Caution:* The UDI may contain personally identifying information in the form of the device *serial number* which may be used to link to other information on a patient. Security and privacy consideration should be addressed, particularly when sending a UDI with a serial number, as that may inadvertently be able to identify a patient. Note: In the US realm that would be addressed by HIPAA.

Note: PRT-10 Device is a repeating field. Additional device identifiers, such as an IEEE EUI-64 may also be contained in this field.

=== 7.5.5 Reporting Cultures and Susceptibilities

==== 7.5.5.0 

==== 7.5.5.1 Culture battery/report representation

Organisms and other observations/tests are reported using multiple OBX segments. The granularity expected for HL7culture reports is one observation per organism.

All OBX segments which have the same observation ID and sub-ID are part of a single observation.

Each organism in a culture battery is assigned a unique _OBX-4 Observation Sub-ID_ (and is therefore a separate observation). The organism name is given in _OBX-5 Observation Value_ (results). It is recommended, but not required, that the organism name may change over time, but the corresponding observation sub-ID never changes. (The observation ID will be identical for all organisms reported.)

Recommended:

OBX|2|CWE|600-7^Micro Organism Identified^LN |2|^S. Aureus||||||F|...<cr>

OBX|2|CWE|600-7^Micro Organism Identified^LN |1|^S. Aureus||||||F|...<cr>

==== 7.5.5.2 Susceptibility battery/report representation

Each antimicrobial should be reported as a separate (OBX) observation where the Observation ID is a code for the antimicrobial. (OBXs for non-antimicrobials observations and related information may be present in the same battery.)

MIC and disk diffusion (Kirby Bauer) susceptibility results can be combined in the same OBX segment. An OBX can contain a MIC value (in _OBX-5 Observation Value_ (results)) and _OBX-8 Interpretation Codes_ that indicates whether the organism is sensitive, resistant, or intermediate (see file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70078[_HL7 Table 0078 - Interpretation Codes_] under abnormal flag fields).

Or, an OBX can contain a disk diffusion result string (e.g., *sensitive*) in the Observation Results field and the disk diffusion interpretation in _OBX-8 Interpretation Codes_ (e.g., *S*).

A susceptibility battery may only contain results corresponding to a single organism that has been previously reported in a culture battery.

==== 7.5.5.3 Identification of the organism for a susceptibility battery

The following is the preferred, but not required method of organizing data about antimicrobial susceptibility.

A susceptibility battery may only contain results corresponding to a single organism that has been previously reported in a culture battery.

A susceptibility battery is always a child order to a culture battery. _OBR-29 Parent_ (parent's filler order number) in the susceptibility OBR is equal _to OBR-3 Filler Order Number_ in the parent culture OBR and is used to link the two batteries logically.

The susceptibility battery also contains a linkage back to a particular organism in the culture battery. _OBR-26 Parent Result_ of the susceptibility OBR contains two components--_OBX-3 Observation Identifier_ (code only) and _OBX -4 Observation Sub-ID_ of the OBX in the culture battery which contains the organism name.

The identity of an organism/isolate is expected to be refined over time. When an organism identification changes, the parent culture battery can be resent without resending the child susceptibility battery.

The case may occur where a susceptibility battery is reported on an organism which has not yet been identified. In this case, it is required that a placeholder OBX for the organism name be reported in the corresponding culture battery so that _OBR-26 Parent Result_ in the susceptibility OBR will point to a valid organism OBX in the culture battery. Transmission of an organism OBX (in the culture battery) with the Sub-ID field valued must precede the susceptibility battery which uses the identical Sub-ID in _OBR-26 Parent Result_.

• No ORC is required because the identifying Fillers Order Number (and other ORC fields) is carried in the OBR segment.

• The EKG application needs to communicate to anyone the original order information, the details of the child orders, the fact of the child spin off, and the results of all three EKGs:

In this case, we are transmitting the information about the fact of child spin off, the original order and the results all at the same time. Thus, this form of the ORU message reports not only the results of an order, but all of its associated ordering information including the original OBR for three EKGs that was replaced by three separate OBR EKG segments.

=== 7.5.8 Patient-connected medical device reporting

Information acquired from patient-connected medical devices may be relatively simple, such as monitored values from a pulse-oximeter or infusion pump, or highly complex and rich such as comprehensive data from a multi-parameter physiological monitor or ventilator. In acute care contexts, many devices may be associated with a single patient and are often added and removed during an episode of care. Though point-of-care devices typically use non-HL7 protocols for their communication interfaces, data acquired from these devices are often aggregated and periodically published to enterprise applications using an HL7-based interface.

In order to enhance interoperability between point-of-care medical device systems and enterprise applications, there have been a number of collaborative projects to establish a consistent mapping of information acquired from these devices to HL7 messages. This clause provides an overview and examples of such a project by the IHE Patient Care Device ("PCD") groupfootnote:[Information on Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (“IHE”), including PCD message profiles are available at http://www.IHE.net[www.IHE.net].] that defines a consistent mapping from specialized device semantics to HL7 messages.

Standardized representation of device semantics is provided by the ISO/IEEE 11073 ("X73") family of standards. Specifically the ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 standardfootnote:[Additional ISO/IEEE 11073-1010x standards may be used to represent abstract device semantics, such as ISO/IEEE 11073-10102 Annotated ECG.] provides a nomenclature or terminology for the representation of device information and is referenced in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[_HL7 Table 0396 – Coding System_] as "MDC."

Additionally, a device-specific information model is defined, ISO/IEEE 11073-10201 Domain Information Model ("DIM"), to support the specialized, real-time communication needs of medical devices. The following diagram presents a simplified example of the X73 objects in which a given observation or Metric::Numeric are contained. The MDS, VMD, and Channel objects provide the information that is often necessary to identify specific devices and their configuration (e.g., serial numbers or internal time settings), as well as the association of data items that come from the same device subsystem (VMD or Channel) and shouldn't be confused with other observations that may have the same identifier.

The IHE PDC Device-to-Enterprise ("DEC") profile defines a single HL7 message, ORU^R01, that maps X73 abstract device semantics to specific message segments and fields. The message specification includes the following:

• Device terms should be communicated using their "MDC" code within and among devices. Between devices and medical record systems other standard vocabulary, e.g., LOINC (emerging as the global standard) and SNOMED, may be used.

• Units of measurement may be either those defined in the ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 Nomenclature, or UCUM. Carrying both is recommended.

• Devices and device-related applications and systems are identified using the 64-bit IEEE EUI-64 identifier (Table 0301) that is specified in the X73 standards.

• OBX-4 is used with a dotted nomenclaturefootnote:[See section 7.4.2.5 OBX-4 Observation Sub-ID discussion, including Figure 7-4 Example of sub‑identifier usage.] to indicate containment of specific measurements within Channels, Virtual Medical Devices and Medical Device Systems.

Complete details of this message profile are defined in the IHE PCD DEC framework. The following message examples illustrate how device information is communicated using this profile.

== 7.6 Clinical Trials

Academic medical institutions, academic research coordinating centers, and industry-based research organizations often have computer systems that support registration, compliance and safety monitoring, and outcomes analysis for clinical trials. Patients on these trials may receive their treatment and evaluation at one research facility or at many different medical facilities. Clinical trials systems could message other applications that a patient is registered on a clinical trial. Several functional examples follow:

{empty}(1) Some of the data required to monitor or analyze outcomes on the trial are generated in other medical computer systems, such as pharmacy, laboratory, or clinical applications. These applications may tag patients on clinical trials so that data may be sent back to the clinical trials system.

{empty}(2) Order entry systems could also use patient registration information: they could display standard order sets for the protocol or particular treatment/evaluation phases of a complex protocol. They could pass the clinical trials status on to service provider applications to initiate a results report to the clinical trials system. It could also be passed to billing applications that may use specialized procedures for research‑related costs.

{empty}(3) Nursing and pharmacy systems can use information on patients' clinical trials status for care plans or dispensing authorization (auxiliary to the physician's prescription), respectively. There could be many other uses of this message since a patient's involvement on a clinical trial affects all concurrent medical care.

To meet monitoring and analysis requirements, patient registration, treatment, diagnostic, and study summary data are reported to study sponsors like pharmaceutical or medical device companies, regulatory agencies, and data management centers for collaborative studies. Automated procedures must be used to transfer these voluminous data among the participant computer systems in a cost-efficient and timely manner. The following additions to HL7 aim to specify standard messaging transactions to automate such reporting as well as to enable communication of clinical trials registration data to relevant medical applications as described above.

The objectives of the clinical trials messages and segments are to identify that patients are registered on clinical trials, have entered a study‑specific phase of treatment or evaluation, or to indicate the study protocol's data schedule. Messages include OBR (section 4.5.3, "OBR - Observation Request Segment"), OBX (section 7.4.2, "OBX ‑ Observation/Result Segment"), RXA (section 4.14.7, "RXA - Pharmacy /Treatment Administration Segment"), and RXR (section 4.14.2, "RXR - pharmacy/Treatment Route Segment") segments to report observations or drug administration that are relevant to the study. In addition to study‑related clinical data, OBX segments may contain the results of study variables according to master code tables such as the Health Outcomes Variables (HL7 Implementation Guide). There are also master segments to describe the clinical trial, its treatment phases, and its scheduled date-time points for message recipients. These are analogous to the Test/Observation Master Segments (Chapter 8), with the trials, phases, or scheduled time points treated as the OMX treats observation identifiers.

=== 7.6.1 Glossary

==== 7.6.1.0 hiddentext

==== 7.6.1.1 Clinical trial:

A scientifically rigorous study of individual outcomes to some process of healthcare intervention. Clinical trials usually involve medical treatments so this document will use the term _treatment_, rather than the broader term _intervention_. A clinical trial design may randomly assign and compare one treatment approach with another, or generate safety and efficacy data on a single treatment approach. The clinical trial has a protocol for the patient's course of treatment and/or evaluation. There is usually a schedule for collection of data to measure compliance, safety, and outcomes.

==== 7.6.1.2 Phase of a clinical trial:

A treatment and/or observation interval of a clinical trial. A phase may represent an interval with a specific treatment regimen assigned randomly or otherwise, with each regimen of a progression of treatments, or with an evaluation component only. Generally, for each phase, there is an explicit patient management, evaluation, and data collection schedule. Each of these phases may have associated safety, outcome, and quality‑control variables. A simpler study design need not use the phase structures.

The phase structure serves several purposes in the clinical trials messages. Other computer systems may need to know that the patient has begun a phase with a particular treatment regimen or diagnostic schedule, such as the pharmacy or order entry systems. When reporting study data, observations and variables often describe particular phase instances. For example, each course of treatment may have its own values for the same set of observations or variables. Phase instances may also have distinct data schedules that need to be linked to submitted data.

Several examples follow with each line depicting a phase.

===== 7.6.1.2.1 Example 1

Alternating treatment plus observation intervals:

__________> _________> _________> _________> ...

Rx A Rx B Rx A Rx B

===== 7.6.1.2.2 Example 2

Random assignment to two courses each of treatment A or B, all responding patients to treatment C, continue with observation and a diagnostic regimen after all treatment phases are completed. Treatment phases include the evaluation component for that course of treatment:

___________> __________

Rx A Crs 1 Rx A Crs 2

\> __________> __________> _______

/ Rx C Crs 1 Rx C Crs 2

Observe

___________> __________/

Rx B Crs 1 Rx B Crs 2

===== 7.6.1.2.3 Example 3

Random assignment to placebo or treatment A, both taken daily and evaluated monthly.

___________> __________> __________> __________> . . .

Month 1 Month 2 Month 3 Month 4

==== 7.6.1.3 Data schedule:

The treatment, diagnostic, and procedural requirements, as well as data collection due dates, scheduled on a timeline for most clinical trials. As data are reported, they may need to reflect the scheduled time point that they satisfy. Clinical trials quality control requires attention to compliance between the protocol's schedule and patient data records.

The data schedule will be keyed by time points relative to the study. Some data may be due prior to and at the conclusion of the study and/or one or more of its phases. Some are interim within the study or its phases depending on protocol events such as administration of treatment, arbitrary time intervals instated to make and record assessments, or some clinical milestone such as relapse of disease. Often, multiple data parameters are scheduled at the same time point. Several examples follow:

=== 7.7.2 CSU - Unsolicited Study Data Message (Events C09-C12)

Data are entered in the clinical trials system or may reside in laboratory, pathology, radiology, pharmacy and/or other clinical applications. Most clinical trials data ‑ clinical observations and study variables ‑ will be communicated in OBR and OBX segments. The CSR, CSP, and CSS segments will identify the specific association these OBR and OBX have to the clinical trial. Data can be broadcast or transmitted in batch mode to study sponsors or the data management center for collaborative studies.

The general acknowledgement message as defined in Chapter 2 should be used for any acknowledgements.

== 7.8 Clinical Trials – Segment Definitions

=== 7.8.1 CSR - Clinical Study Registration Segment

The CSR segment will contain fundamental administrative and regulatory information required to document a patient's enrollment on a clinical trial. This segment is all that is required if one needs to message another system that an enrollment has taken place, i.e., from clinical trials to pharmacy, accounting, or order entry systems. The CSR segment may also be used to identify that OBR, OBX, RXA, and RXR segments that follow represent data applicable to the identified study.

==== 7.8.1.0 CSR field definitions

==== 7.8.1.1 CSR-1 Sponsor Study ID (EI) 01011

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: The field contains the universal identifier for the clinical trial. Since many clinical trials are collaborative and multi‑centered, and since one goal of these standards is to promote automated data exchange among sites, the primary identifier should come from the sponsor. The coding system component may reference the sponsor. Example:

T93‑0807^NCI (where NCI refers to the National Cancer Institute).

==== 7.8.1.2 CSR-2 Alternate Study ID (EI) 01036

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

=== 7.8.2 CSP - Clinical Study Phase Segment 

The CSP segment contains information on a patient's status for a particular phase of the study. This segment is optional and is useful when a study has different evaluation intervals within it. (See section _7.8.1_, "_HL7 Attribute Table – CSR – Clinical Study Registration_," and section _7.6.1.2_, "_Phase of a clinical trial:_.") The CSP segment is implemented on a study‑specific basis for messaging purposes. The fact that the patient has entered a phase of the study that represents a certain treatment approach may need to be messaged to other systems, like pharmacy, nursing, or order entry. It is also important to sponsors and data management centers for tracking patient progress through the study and monitoring the data schedule defined for each phase. It may subsume OBR and OBX segments that follow it to indicate that these data describe the phase.

Definition: This field identifies the phase of the study that a patient has entered. The set of codes will generally be developed for each clinical trial, although there are patterns that trials in particular disease or prevention categories may follow. The phase structure will be based on data collation and reporting needs for the study. It is an operational structure and need not be discussed in the clinical trial protocol documentation or even made known to patient care or data collection personnel. The coding system will usually be developed by the sponsor for multicentered clinical trials to standardize the receipt of automated data. Local codes could be added if an additional local message is desired. Otherwise, local coding conventions will be used. Refer to Table 0587 - Study Phase Identifier in Chapter 2C for valid values.

== 7.10 Product Experience

Patients experience symptoms, manifest signs or develop diseases or syndromes while exposed to medical devices and/or drugs. Evidence suggests that some of these symptoms, signs, diseases or syndromes may develop as a consequence of the products used. Examples include the development of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina in the daughters of mothers treated with diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy and gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. While it is difficult to prove causality, strong evidence exists in many cases.

It is important to document such experiences during the development and testing of products to identify potential adverse effects but also during routine use of the product to identify serious adverse effects which occur infrequently. The latter is the realm of pharmacoepidemiology and post-marketing surveillance.

Adverse events are important for product manufacturers as signal generating hypotheses concerning drug kinetics or dynamics, often in special populations of patients. Adverse events are important for regulators in ensuring that manufacturers protect the public health in assessments of risk and benefits, including special populations, and that they promptly and thoroughly investigate individual events and clusters of events. Adverse events are especially important for practitioners and patients who always deal with a special population of one individual who may be having an event and a practitioner seeking information about related events seen with the same or similar products.

Reporting has usually focused on _serious_ and _unexpected_ events. Serious, if defined unambiguously, focuses attention on those events of most importance to the patient and practitioner. Expected events are those which prior experience has demonstrated to be probabilistically linked to the product and are generally included in product labeling.

Because of the risks associated with the uses of drugs and medical devices, a system of surveillance has been established in most developed countries. With globalization of the marketplace, the need to share this information across national boundaries has increased. Currently most reporting is performed using a series of forms, including CIOMS, yellow cards, the FDA's 1639 and MedWatch forms and the Japanese form, which are sent:

• from identified reporting sources to regulatory bodies

• from identified reporting sources to product manufacturers

• between regulatory bodies

• within product manufacturers

• within regulatory bodies

• from product manufacturers to regulatory bodies

• from regulatory bodies to the WHO Collaborative Drug Surveillance Center

Regardless of who originates a drug experience report, documentation of the experience eventually reaches the regulatory agencies. The manufacturer is mandated to alert the regulatory agency.

Electronic interchange of these data would reduce errors, decrease costs and speed communications.

=== 7.10.1 Glossary

==== 7.10.1.0 hiddentext

==== 7.10.1.1 Drug:

Any chemical compound that may be used on or administered to humans or animals as an aid in the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of disease or other abnormal condition, for the relief of pain or suffering, or to control or improve any physiological condition (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 27^th^ edition).

==== 7.10.1.2 Medical device:

Something contrived for or used in the diagnosis (vascular catheters), treatment (thermotherapy units) or prevention of disease or other abnormal condition, for the relief of pain or suffering or to control or improve any physiologic condition, including instrumentation and implanted devices (prosthetic cardiac valves, pacemakers, hip prostheses).

==== 7.10.1.3 Product:

A drug or medical device.

==== 7.10.1.4 Non-proprietary (generic) name:

Drug name that is not protected by a trademark, usually descriptive of its chemical structure; sometimes called a public name. In the US, most generic drug names are assigned by the US Adopted Name Council (USAN). Other generic names in common use are the National Formulary (NF) and the US Pharmacopoeia (USP) names. Figure 7-3 lists other available drug coding systems.

==== 7.10.1.5 Trade (brand) name:

Proprietary names that are registered to protect the name for the sole use of the manufacturer holding the trademark.

==== 7.10.1.6 Adverse event/adverse experience: 

• Pre-marketing: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.

• Post-marketing/European Union: Any undesirable experience occurring to a patient treated with a pharmaceutical product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.

• Post-marketing/US: Any adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including the following: An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from drug overdose; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected pharmacologic action.

• WHO: Any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a pharmaceutical product but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this product.

==== 7.10.1.7 Adverse drug reaction: 

• Pre-marketing: All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose.

• Post-marketing/WHO: A response to a drug which is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for the modification of physiologic function

• Post-marketing/European Union: A reaction which is harmful and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment of disease or the modification of physiological function.

• Post-marketing/US: Any undesirable effect reasonably associated with the use of the drug that may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the drug or may be unpredictable.

==== 7.10.1.8 Causation:

An exposure which truly does increase or decrease the probability of a certain outcome.

==== 7.10.1.9 Causal relationship:

When an event occurs a product may be suspected as causing the event but rarely can it be proven particularly at an early stage of the product's life. Certain information about the relationship between the product and the event can reinforce the belief in a causal relationship between the product and the event while others can decrease the probability that there is a causal relationship.

==== 7.10.1.10 Regulatory agency:

Many geopolitical entities have established agencies/authority responsible for regulating products used in health care. The agencies are collectively referred to as regulatory agencies.

==== 7.10.1.11 Product manufacturer:

The organization which is responsible for the manufacture of a product. This will usually be the entity, which holds the marketing authorization for the product.

==== 7.10.1.12 Holder of marketing authorization:

The organization which holds the authority to market a product. This will often be the organization, which manufactures the product.

==== 7.10.1.13 Serious adverse product reaction:

An adverse product reaction which:

• is fatal (results in death)

• is life threatening

• requires hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization

• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity

• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also be considered serious.

==== 7.10.1.14 Expected adverse product reaction:

Expected events are those which prior experience has demonstrated to be probabilistically linked to the product and are generally included in product labeling.

Pre-marketing: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved investigational product).

Post-marketing/European Union: This relates to an adverse reaction which is not mentioned in any EC summary of product characteristics (SPC). In the absence of any European SPC, an international document prepared by the marketing authorization holder containing all relevant safety information which the marketing authorization holder considers should be listed for the medicinal product in all countries where the medicinal product is marketed (Care Data Sheet).

Post-marketing/US current: Unexpected means an adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product and includes an event that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity.

Post-marketing/US (proposed): The applicant's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should e listed for the drug in all countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this post-marketing periodic report.

Post-marketing/WHO: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with domestic labeling or market authorization, or expected from characteristics of the drug.

The PID segment provides the patient identification information including institutional identification numbers, date of birth and in the case of patients who die, information about their death. Patients are frequently identified only by their initials which can be represented in the PID segment, e.g., the initials JMO would appear as J^M^O in the name field of the PID segment. The EVN segment identifies the type of transaction that is being sent -- primarily it specifies who the sender is and implies which information is expected to be included in the message. A message sent from a healthcare provider, for example, might contain minimal information, while a message from a pharmaceutical manufacturer might contain nearly complete information.

The PES or Product Experience Sender segment provides information about the message sender and its knowledge of the event. The heart of the product experience message is the product experience observation (PEO) segment and the PCR segments clustered under it. The PEO segment identifies a clinical event and the PCR segments identify products which are potentially causally related to the event. There may be more than one product which is potentially related to the event so multiple PCR segments can be included. RXE and RXR segments can be repeated and provide information about the products the patient was exposed to at the time of the event (typically excluding those used to treat the event). Details about the administration of the products identified in the PCR segments should be described with RXE and RXR segments. Repeated PRB segments provide information about diagnoses which represent comorbid conditions. The repeated OBX segments are used to send patient observations such as height, weight, last menstrual period, and laboratory results. Analytical commentary can be included in the NTE segment. This commentary will typically be the sender's analysis of the event and the potentially causally related products. Finally, the CSR and CSP segments can optionally be included if the event occurred during a formal clinical trial in order to describe the trial.

When a product experience relates to an exposure which occurred indirectly (transmammary or transplacentally for example), the individual experiencing the adverse effect — the fetus or child — would be described in the PID segment and the individual via which they are exposed in the NK1 segment. The first set of RXE segments would typically indicate the drugs which to which the fetus or child was exposed. Additional codes for the route are defined in this Appendix to allow the suspected routes of exposure to be represented. The second set of RXE/RXR segment - those clustered under the NK1 segment - would represent the route by which the mother or father was exposed to the drug. Early spontaneous abortion would normally be treated as an adverse effect on the mother rather than on the fetus, and the PID would refer to the mother. The second set of PRB/OBX segments reflects the problems/observations associated with the individual via which they were exposed.

Each message contains information about a single case including one patient (PID), at least one sender (PES), one or more events (PEO) and one or more suspected products (PCR and RXE/RXA) for a minimal message. The structure of the message allows actual administration information to be sent in the RXA if known; if administration information is unavailable, or the adverse reaction cannot be related to a single administration event, the RXE segment can be used to send prescription level information. Additional information may be included based on availability and regulatory requirements.

The MSH segment specifies the character set (_MSH-18_) and the language (_MSH-19_) used in the PEX message.

The PEX message is designed to accommodate required reporting of adverse product events to the responsible regulatory agencies. In the United States, the paper version of this report is Medwatch.

==== 7.12.1.5 PES-5 Sender Event Identifier (EI) 01064

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: The first component of this field contains the product manufacturer's unique alphanumeric identifier for this specific event. This identifier will be used on all subsequent communications regarding this event. For events reported to the FDA, the identifier is: the FDA assigned manufacturer or distributor number; a hyphen; the 4-digit year; a hyphen; and a consecutive 5-digit sequence number for each report filled by the sender that year. For example, the event identifier for the third event reported in 1996 by a manufacturer whose FDA-assigned registration number is 1234567 would be 1234567-1993-3. Organizations without a FDA-assigned registration number should use 0000000 until assigned a number. Reports from other facilities should use the 10-digit HCFA number left padded with zeros in place of the FDA-assigned registration number. The second through fourth components are defined in exactly the same way as the three components of the hierarchic designator (HD) data type (Section 2.8.18, "HD - hierarchic designator").

=== 7.12.2 PEO - Product Experience Observation Segment 

Details related to a particular clinical experience or event are embodied in the PEO segment. This segment can be used to characterize an event which might be attributed to a product to which the patient was exposed. Products with a possible causal relationship to the observed experience are described in the following PCR (possible causal relationship) segments. The message format was designed to be robust and includes many optional elements which may not be required for a particular regulatory purpose but allow a complete representation of the drug experience if needed.

A PEX message can contain multiple PEO segments if the patient experienced more than one event but must contain at least one PEO segment.

==== 7.16.1.0 Segment Notes

The Participation (PRT) segment following the Shipment (SHP) segment is used to document participants in a shipment. A minimum of one Participation segment is required for documenting the destination of the shipment. Other participants including shipment originator, shipment packer, shipment waypoints, etc. can also be documented using the Participation segment.

The Observation/Result (OBX) segment in the SHIPPING_OBSERVATION segment group is used to carry any additional shipping information or observations that are not carried in the Shipment segment.

The Participation (PRT) segment following the Specimen (SPM) segment is used to identify the person(s) who collected the specimen.

The Observation/Result (OBX) segment in the SPECIMEN_OBSERVATION segment group is used to document any additional shipping information that is not conveyed in the Specimen (SPM) segment.

The Container (SAC) segment is used to document the containers for a specimen. If it is necessary to document where in a package a particular specimen container is found, use SAC-11 (Position in Carrier) to convey this position. SAC-10 (Carrier Identifier) can be used to carry the identifier of the package within which the specimen container is located.

The Observation/Result (OBX) segment in the CONTAINER_OBSERVATION segment group is used to document observations regarding the specimen container.

The SUBJECT_PERSON/ANIMAL_IDENTIFICATION segment group is used to associate a specimen with the person or animal the specimen was obtained from. If the subject of the testing is something other than a person, the Next of Kin/Associated Parties (NK1) segment will document the person or organization responsible or owning the subject. For patients who are persons, the NK1 segment documents the next of kin of the patient.

If the specimen was obtained from a population of animals or a location then the SUBJECT_POPULATION/LOCATION_IDENTIFICATION segment group should be used instead. The Patient Identification (PID) segment in this segment group is used to carry the species, breed and strain information for a population. The Next of Kin (NK1) segment in this segment group is used to convey information regarding the owner or responsible party for a population of animals or a location.

The Patient Visit (PV1) segment is used to provide basic information about a patient encounter where the specimen was taken.

The Observation/Result (OBX) segment in the PATIENT_VISIT_OBSERVATION segment group is used to document observations regarding the visit.

==== 7.16.1.1 Actors

===== 7.16.1.1.1 Specimen Shipper

The Specimen Shipper actor is an application capable of sending specimen shipments and transmitting the specimen shipment manifest message.

===== 7.16.1.1.2 Specimen Shipment Receiver

The Specimen Shipment Receiver actor is an application capable of receiving specimen shipments as well as specimen shipment manifest messages. Typically this application is associated with a Laboratory.

==== 7.16.1.2 Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram illustrates the usage of this message. The message is initially sent from the Specimen Shipper at the point the specimen is shipped. The actual point of transmission of the message could occur as soon as all the contents of the shipment have been identified, and the transporters shipment id has been assigned to the shipment. The specimen shipment receiver will send back transaction using the Specimen Shipment Manifest message indicating the specimen shipment has been accepted or rejected. This normally will occur after the shipment has been physically received and evaluated. Note that this response back is not considered an application acknowledgment, and is certainly not required. Its purpose is to update the shipper with the status of the shipment.

|*Note:* The abbreviations for conventional U.S. units of time are the same as ISO, except for year. ISO = ANN, AMSI = yr. The metric units in X3.50 are the same as ISO, except for: pascal ("pa" in ANSI, "pal" in ISO); ANSI uses "min" for both time and arc while ISO uses "mnt" for minutes of arc; and in ISA seconds are abbreviated "s", in ANSI, "sec". | | | | | | | | | |
|*Caution:* Because the ANS+ specification includes both ISO and US customary units, as well as miscellaneous non-metric units, some of the abbreviations are ambiguous. Although there should be little confusion, in the context of a particular observation, this ambiguity is a good reason for a voiding ANS+ unit codes when possible. | | | | | | | | | |

The ISO abbreviations for multiplier prefixes are given in Figure 7-13. Prefixes ranging from 10^-24^ (1/billion billionth) to 10^24^ (a billion billion) are available. The single case abbreviation for kilo (x1000) is *k*. A unit consisting of 1000 seconds would be abbreviated as *ks*, 1000 grams as *kg*, 1000 meters as *km*, and so on. Some prefixes share the abbreviation of a base unit. Farad and femto, for example, (10^-18^) both have the abbreviation of *f*. To avoid confusion, ISO forbids the use of solitary prefixes. It also deprecates the use of two prefixes in one complex unit. Thus, *f* always means farad, *ff* would mean 1 million billionth of a farad. Compound prefixes are not allowed.

A unit can be raised to an exponential power. Positive exponents are represented by a number immediately following a unit's abbreviation, i.e., a square meter would be denoted by m2. Negative exponents are signified by a negative number following the base unit, e.g., *1/m2* would be represented *as m-2.* Fractional exponents are expressed by a numeric fraction in parentheses: the square root of a meter would be expressed as m(1/2). The multiplication of units is signified by a period (.) between the units, e.g., meters X seconds would be denoted *m.s*. Notice that spaces are not permitted. Division is signified by a slash (/) between two units, e.g. meters per second would be denoted as *m/s*. Algebraic combinations of ISO unit abbreviations constructed by dividing, multiplying, or exponentiating base ISO units, are also valid ISO abbreviations units. Exponentiation has precedence over multiplication or division. For example, microvolts squared per hertz (a unit of spectral power) would be denoted *uv2/hz* and evaluated as uv ^2^/hz while microvolts per square root of hertz (a unit of spectral amplitude) would be denoted uv/hz(1/2) and evaluated as uv/hz^½^. If more than one division operator is included in the expression the associations should be parenthesized to avoid any ambiguity, but the best approach is to convert a/(b/c) to a.c/b or a.c.b-1 to simplify the expression.

Figure 7-9 lists the abbreviations for common ISO derived units. It also includes standard unit abbreviations for common units, e.g., Milliequivalents, and international units, mm(Hg), and for counting per which we denote by a division sign, a denominator, but no numerator, e.g., /c, that are not part of the above referenced ISO standards. We have extended the units table to better accommodate drug routes and physiologic measures, and otherwise fill in gaps in v2.2.

We have generally followed the IUPAC 1995 Silver Book^2^ in the definitions of units. However, IUPAC specifies standards for reporting or displaying units and employs 8-bit data sets to distinguish them. This Standard is concerned with the _transmission_ of patient information. Therefore, we have restricted ourselves to case insensitive alphabetic characters and a few special characters (e.g., ".", "/", "(", ")", "*", and "_") to avoid any possible confusion in the transmission. Therefore, we use ISO 2955-1983 (Information processing -- representation of SI and other units in systems with limited character sets) and ANSI X3.50-1986 (Representations for U.S. customary, SI, and other units to be used in systems with limited character sets) case insensitive units abbreviations where they are defined. This means that in some cases, IUPAC abbreviations have different abbreviations in ISO+ even when the IUPAC abbreviations use only standard alphabetic characters. For example, *Pascal* is abbreviated *Pa* in IUPAC but *PAL* in ISO+ (following ISO 2955) because *Pa* in a case insensitive context also means *Picoampere*. However, the requirements for transmission do not preclude usage of IUPAC standards for presentation on paper or video display reports to end-users.

All unit abbreviations are case insensitive. One could write milliliters as ML, ml, or mL. In this table we have used lower case for all of the abbreviations except for the letter *L* which we represent in upper case so that readers will not confuse it with the numeral one (1). This is just a change in presentation, not a change in the Standard. Systems should continue to send the codes as upper or lower case as they always have.
