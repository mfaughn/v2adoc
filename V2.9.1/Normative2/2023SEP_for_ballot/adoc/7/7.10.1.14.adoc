==== 7.10.1.14 Expected adverse product reaction:

Expected events are those which prior experience has demonstrated to be probabilistically linked to the product and are generally included in product labeling.

Pre-marketing: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved investigational product).

Post-marketing/European Union: This relates to an adverse reaction which is not mentioned in any EC summary of product characteristics (SPC). In the absence of any European SPC, an international document prepared by the marketing authorization holder containing all relevant safety information which the marketing authorization holder considers should be listed for the medicinal product in all countries where the medicinal product is marketed (Care Data Sheet).

Post-marketing/US current: Unexpected means an adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product and includes an event that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity.

Post-marketing/US (proposed): The applicant's core safety data sheet shall be a document prepared by the applicant that contains all relevant safety information, including adverse drug experiences, which the applicant believes should e listed for the drug in all countries where the drug is marketed. It may be used by the applicant as the reference document by which an adverse drug experience is judged to be expected or unexpected for purposes of this post-marketing periodic report.

Post-marketing/WHO: An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with domestic labeling or market authorization, or expected from characteristics of the drug.
