==== 7.5.5.2 Susceptibility battery/report representation

Each antimicrobial should be reported as a separate (OBX) observation where the Observation ID is a code for the antimicrobial. (OBXs for non-antimicrobials observations and related information may be present in the same battery.)

MIC and disk diffusion (Kirby Bauer) susceptibility results can be combined in the same OBX segment. An OBX can contain a MIC value (in _OBX-5 Observation Value_ (results)) and _OBX-8 Interpretation Codes_ that indicates whether the organism is sensitive, resistant, or intermediate (see file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70078[_HL7 Table 0078 - Interpretation Codes_] under abnormal flag fields).

Or, an OBX can contain a disk diffusion result string (e.g., *sensitive*) in the Observation Results field and the disk diffusion interpretation in _OBX-8 Interpretation Codes_ (e.g., *S*).

A susceptibility battery may only contain results corresponding to a single organism that has been previously reported in a culture battery.
