Definition: This field contains the code and/or text indicating any known or suspected patient or specimen hazards, e.g., patient with active tuberculosis or blood from a hepatitis patient. Either code and/or text may be absent. However, the code is always placed in the first component position and any free text in the second component. Thus, free text without a code must be preceded by a component delimiter. Refer to Table 0613 - Danger Code in Chapter 2C for valid values.
