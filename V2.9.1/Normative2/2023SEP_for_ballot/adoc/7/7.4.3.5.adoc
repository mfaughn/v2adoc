Definition: This field contains modifying or qualifying description(s) about the specimen type

The use of this attribute is to modify, qualify or further specify, the entity described by _SPM-4 -Specimen Type_. This is particularly useful when the code set used in _SPM-4-Specimen Type_ does not provide the precision required to fully describe the specimen. For example, if the specimen was precisely described as 'capillary venous blood' but the code set employed only provided 'venous blood,' this attribute could be employed to add the modifier 'capillary.'
