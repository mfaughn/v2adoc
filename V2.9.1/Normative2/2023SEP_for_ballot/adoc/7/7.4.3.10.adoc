Definition: This field differs from _SPM-8-Specimen Source Site_ in those cases where the source site must be approached via a particular site (e.g., anatomic location). For example, in the case where a liver biopsy is obtained via a percutaneous needle, the collection site would be the point of entry of the needle. For venous blood collected from the left radial vein, the collection site could be "antecubital fossa".

Veterinary medicine may choose the tables supported for the components of this field as decided by their industry.
