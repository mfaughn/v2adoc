Definition: This field specifies the volume or mass of the collected specimen. For laboratory tests, the collection volume is the volume of a specimen. Specifically, units should be expressed in the ISO Standard unit abbreviations (ISOâ€‘2955, 1977). This is a results-only field except when the placer or a party has already drawn the specimen. Use of UCUM is strongly recommended as one of the delivered units (could be in addition to the local units). (See Chapter 7 Section 7.4.2.6 for a full discussion regarding units.)
