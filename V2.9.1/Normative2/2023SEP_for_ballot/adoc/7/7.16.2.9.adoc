Definition: The shipment condition field allows the receiver of the shipment to document the condition of the shipment when it was received. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70544[_HL7 Table 0544 â€“ Container Condition_] for suggested values. Many of the values found in Table 0544 are associated with values found in Table 0376 (Special Handling Codes). Values from Table 0376 have had an X placed in front of them, and the meaning of the code has been changed to indicate that the type of handling has failed during shipment. For instance if a handling code indicated that the shipment was to be kept at body temperature (C37), and the shipment arrived at some other temperature, the XC37 condition code would be used to indicate the shipment arrived with a temperature outside the range indicated by the handling code.
