== 17.3 Purpose

This Materials Management chapter defines abstract messages for the purpose of communicating various events related to the transactions derived from supply chain management within a healthcare facility. There are two basic types of messages defined in this chapter: _inventory item master file updates, and supply item sterilization messages_.

The inventory item master file segments published in this chapter are based on master file add and update messages between applications such as _materials management, scheduling, and sterilization applications._

The sterilization and decontamination messages published in this chapter are based on a request, response, or unsolicited update. These transactions occur between an instrument-tracking system and a sterilizer or washer.

This chapter describes various roles under which applications might operate. The roles discussed in this chapter illustrate the underlying model used to develop this specification. They do not imply the need for a particular application model or method of implementation.

This chapter defines the transactions at the seventh level, that is, the abstract message. Various schemes are used to generate the actual characters that comprise the messages according to the communication environment. The HL7 Encoding Rules will be used where there is not a complete Presentation Layer. This is described in Chapter 1, "Relationship to Other Protocols." The examples included in this chapter were constructed using the HL7 Encoding Rules.

=== 17.3.1 Inventory Item Master Updates

The goal of the Inventory Item Master Update message specifications is to facilitate the communication of inventory item master catalog and lot information between applications. The main subject of such communication is the _supply item_. These inventory item master segments are used with trigger event M15 – Inventory Item Master File Message , and M16 – Inventory Item Master File Message – Enhanced. The message structures of these events are published in Chapter 8 - Master Files.

==== 17.3.1.0 Item Master Catalog

The _item master catalog_ provides a catalog of supplies used for ordering to replenish inventory at supply locations, for general usage in a healthcare facility for scheduled appointments, surgery, and to provide identifiers for instrument-tracking used for the sterilization process. The catalog consists of numerous attributes related to a supply item. Supply items and associated attributes can be specific to a domain such as Inventory, Scheduling, Pharmacy, and Sterilization.

==== 17.3.1.1 Inventory Locations

Inventory locations contain a list of items that are stocked at the location, or that can be ordered from the location (but not stocked on a regular basis). Inventory locations receive updates to the attributes of supply items from the general supply location's item master catalog. Even though the general supply location's item master catalog and the other inventory locations item master both share the majority of the supply item attributes, those attributes can have a different value in each location. For example, the status of a supply item (active, inactive, pending inactive), can be inactive in the general supply location item master catalog (meaning it cannot be ordered), but the same item may be pending inactive at another inventory location that still has the supply item in stock, and will issue the supply item until the stock is depleted, but cannot order to replenish the stock at this location.

The following are the primary attributes of a supply item:

____
Unique identification code

• The unique identification code for a supply item describes a relation to a supply that can be ordered. This would likely be a catalog number specific to a manufacturer of the supply item.

Supply Item Description

• The name or text description of the supply item provides a human-readable identification of the supply.

Supply Item Type

• This attribute describes a type or class of supply items. This would typically be a supply type such as office supplies, OR supplies, or laboratory supplies.
____

=== 17.3.2 Sterilization and Decontamination

Sterilization and decontamination messages in this chapter are exchanged between a sterilizer or washer and an Instrument-tracking System.  The main focus of the sterilization and decontamination process is a load or grouping of _supply items_. These messages communicate sterilizer configuration, sterilizer lot, and device and cycle data messages related to instances of sterilizing and decontaminating supply items.

_Sterilization_ is a process used to render a product free from viable microorganisms in order to meet infection prevention standards. Sterilizers are defined as apparatus used to sterilize medical devices, equipment and supplies by direct exposure to the sterilizing agent. The typical sterilizing agent for high temperature sterilization is saturated steam under pressure; low temperature sterilizing agents are peracetic acid or ethylene oxide gas.

_Decontamination_ is defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as the use of physical or chemical means to remove, inactivate or destroy blood-borne pathogens on a surface or item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use or disposal. \{29 CFR 1910.1030} Washers provide decontamination services in order to render items safe for handling.

Steam sterilizers have defined cycles that achieve sterilization by attaining certain temperatures for specific lengths of time. These cycles are validated using AAMI (Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation) standards.

Ethylene Oxide gas and peracetic acid sterilizers have defined cycles that are validated by the manufacturer's research to achieve sterilization at specific temperatures and exposure times to the sterilant.

Sterilization and decontamination cycles are defined as a sequence of steps or phases that are designed to achieve sterilization or decontamination.

Typical phases for steam sterilization include Condition, Sterilize and Exhaust. Phases for Ethylene Oxide sterilization include Condition, Sterilize, Exhaust and Aerate. Peracetic acid sterilizers also have similar phases.

The following tables contain examples of typical cycles for sterilizers and washers.

=== 17.3.3 Application roles

In the sterilization and decontamination specification, there are two roles that an application can assume: a filler application role, and a placer application role. These application roles define the interaction that an application will have with other applications in the messaging environment. In many environments, any one application may take on more than one application role.

In this specification, the definition of application roles is not intended to define or limit the functionality of specific products developed by vendors of such applications. Instead, this information is provided to help define the model used to develop this specification, and to provide an unambiguous way for applications to communicate with each other.

== 17.4 Trigger Events

This chapter defines trigger events used to communicate supply item information between applications.

The inventory item master file notification trigger events are defined in Chapter 8, Master Files. The sterilization and decontamination related trigger events in this chapter are defined in section _17.5_, "_Inventory Item Master Messages Segments_," and _17.6_, "_Placer Application Requests and Trigger Events_."

=== 17.4.1 Statuses

The status of a supply item describes the state of the supply item in the item master catalog and at an inventory location. Typical statuses of a supply item may include the following: Active, Pending Inactive, and Inactive.

The status of a load describes the state of a load during a sterilization cycle. Typical statuses of a load may include the following: Pending, Active, Complete, and Canceled.

=== 17.4.3 Organization of This Chapter: Trigger Events and Message Definitions

This specification contains four functional groupings of trigger events and message definitions. The trigger events within each of the placer, filler, and query functional groupings share the same or similar message definitions.

The first functional grouping of trigger events and message definitions describes the common master file notification messages for use of the record level events for adds, deletes, updates, deactivations, and reactivations. This functional grouping is specific to the item master inventory messages.

The second functional grouping of trigger events and message definitions describes _placer request transactions_. This grouping defines the trigger events and message definitions for transactions from applications acting in a placer application role, and also defines the related filler application response messages sent back by applications fulfilling the auxiliary role. These messages are described in section _17.6_, "_Placer Application Requests and Trigger Events_."

The second functional grouping describes trigger events and message definitions for _unsolicited transactions_ from applications acting in the filler application role. This grouping describes the unsolicited messages originating from an application fulfilling the filler role, and the response messages sent back by applications fulfilling the auxiliary role. These messages are described in section _17.7_, "_Filler Application Messages and Trigger Events Unsolicited_."

The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality, and repetition of segments is described in Chapter 2, "Format for defining abstract messages."

==== 17.4.3.0 Update mode

This chapter uses the "Action code/unique identifier" mode for updating via repeating segments. For more information on updating via repeating segments, please see section 2.15.4, "Modes for updating via repeating segments," in Chapter 2. The definition of the "Action code/unique identifier" update mode can be found in Chapter 2, section 2.15.4.2, "Action code/unique identifier mode update definition."

== 17.5 Inventory Item Master Messages Segments

This section describes the segments described in the Inventory Item Master File Message (Event M15) and Inventory Item Master File Message - Enhanced (Event M16) master file messages. The description of these events and the messages structures are published in Chapter 8, Master Files. The M15 Inventory Item Master File trigger event and the IIM inventory item master segment is a limited implementation. The M16 Inventory Item Master File - Enhanced trigger event is a comprehensive Materials Management message.

The enhanced inventory item master message communicates additions and updates of supply items and their attributes from a general supply location to additional supply locations within a healthcare facility.

The general supply inventory location sends a transaction to multiple inventory locations with this trigger event, communicating adds and changes to item master catalog and inventory supply items.

The ILT segment formerly published in v2.5 Chapter 8, Master Files, will now be published in this chapter because of its use in the Materials Management domain.

=== 17.5.1 IIM - Inventory Item Master Segment

The Inventory Item Master segment (IIM) contains information about the stock of product that can be used to fulfill an ordered test/service. All of the fields in this segment describe the test/service and other basic attributes pertaining to Service Item defined within an Other Observation/Service Item master file. This segment is related to centrally stocked or supply management concerns.

== 17.6 Placer Application Requests and Trigger Events

Placer request and filler response transactions are the messages and trigger events used between placer applications and filler applications. The placer application initiates transactions using the *SLR, STI, SDR,* or *SMD* message types, requesting information with the given trigger event message detail. The filler application responds to these requests, using the *SLS, STS, SDS,* or *SMS* message types, to either grant or deny the requests from the placer application.

When initiating a request, the placer application will generate and send a message type containing all of the information necessary to communicate the desired action to the filler application. All required segments and fields (both explicitly required and conditionally required) should be provided to the filler application, as defined in this chapter. When the filler application receives the transaction, it acknowledges it with the appropriate accept acknowledgment using an *ACK* message (assuming that the enhanced acknowledgment mode is in use).

After processing the request at the application level, the filler acknowledges the transaction with the appropriate application acknowledgment in a response message type (again assuming that an application acknowledgment was requested under the enhanced acknowledgment mode or that the original acknowledgment mode is in use). Applying the explanations of the various application acknowledgment codes in the context of this chapter, an application accept from the filler means that the request was processed and accepted by the filler.

An application error from the filler means that the request was processed and denied. An application reject from the filler means that the request was not, and could not be, processed due to one or more reasons unrelated to its content (for example, it fails the basic application protocol validation, the filler system is down, or there was an internal error).

There are no unsolicited messages initiated from a filler application defined in this set of trigger events. Those messages and trigger events are defined below, in section _17.7_, "_Filler Application Messages and Trigger Events Unsolicited_."

All of the trigger events associated with placer request and filler response transactions use the message definitions that follow:

=== 17.6.1 SLR/ACK/SLS - Request New Sterilization Lot (Event S28)

A placer application (Sterilizer) sends a transaction with this trigger event to a filler application (Instrument-tracking system) to request that a new sterilization lot be added. If it is successful, the filler application returns an application acknowledgment (if requested under the enhanced acknowledgment mode, or if the original acknowledgment mode is in use).

=== 17.6.2 SLR/ACK/SLS - Request Sterilization Lot Deletion (Event S29)

A request sterilization lot deletion is sent by the placer application to the filler application to request that a lot that had been created in error be removed from the system. A delete trigger event differs from a cancel trigger event in that a delete acts to remove an error, whereas a cancel acts to prevent a valid request from occurring. If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned.

The delete trigger event should be implemented with careful forethought, as it typically has different effects and repercussions in various applications. In some applications, a delete event cannot be undone. This means that if a delete transaction was sent erroneously, recovery will be difficult or impossible. In other applications, a delete transaction will not result in the physical deletion of the record(s), but will set a status or a flag. In these cases, the filler and/or placer appointment identifiers (the numbers or codes that uniquely identify the sterilization lot or request to the placer and filler applications) probably cannot be reused. Since an application may maintain a record of deleted sterilization lots, the reuse of an identifier may cause a conflict in the applications' processing of transactions.

== 17.7 Filler Application Messages and Trigger Events Unsolicited

Unsolicited transactions from filler applications are the messages and trigger events used between filler applications and auxiliary applications. Transactions are initiated by the filler application, using the *STC* message to notify auxiliary applications of a sterilization configuration set. The auxiliary application responds to these notifications, using the *ACK* message, either to acknowledge receipt of the transaction, or to signal that an interfacing error of some kind has occurred.

As the discussion of application roles has indicated above, any one application can have more than one application role. If it is important that the application acting in the placer application role in your messaging environment be notified of unsolicited sterilization configurations, then it must also support the role of an auxiliary application.

When initiating a notification transaction, the filler application will generate and send an *STC, SLN, SDN,* or *SCN* message containing all of the information necessary to communicate the desired information to the auxiliary application. All required segments and fields (both explicitly required and conditionally required) should be provided by the filler application, as defined in this chapter. When the auxiliary application receives the transaction, it acknowledges with the appropriate accept acknowledgment using an *ACK* message (assuming that the enhanced acknowledgment mode is in use). After processing the notification at the application level, the auxiliary application acknowledges the transaction with the appropriate application acknowledgment in an *ACK* message (assuming that an application acknowledgment was requested under the enhanced acknowledgment mode or that the original acknowledgment mode is in use). Applying the explanations of the various application acknowledgment codes (detailed in Chapter 2) in the context of this chapter, an application accept from the auxiliary application means that the notification was processed and accepted. An application error from the auxiliary application means that the auxiliary application was unable to process the notification at the application level. An application reject from the auxiliary application means that the request was not, and could not be, processed due to one or more reasons unrelated to its content (for example, it fails the basic application protocol validation, the system is down, or there was an internal error).

=== 17.7.1 STC/ACK - Notification of Sterilization Configuration (Event S33)

==== 17.9.1.0 DEV Field Definitions

==== 17.9.1.1 DEV-1 Action code (ID) 02534

Definition: This field reveals the intent of the message. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70287[_HL7 Table 0287 – Problem/goal action code_] for valid values.

==== 17.9.1.2 DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier (EI) 02457

Components: <Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains a unique identifier for the Device represented, either an actual device, or type of device.

When this segment is used as an extension of a PRT segment in the message, e.g., additional device information obtained for an implantable device, DEV-2 must be equal to PRT-10 Participation Device. When PRT-22 Participation Device Type is used, DEV-3 must be equal to PRT-22.

Condition: Either DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or DEV-3 Device Type must be valued, or both are valued.

==== 17.9.1.3 DEV-3 Device Type (CNE) 03483

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains the type of device used in the participation.

See Externally HL7 defined 0961 in Chapter 2C for a list of suggested values. This field can repeat.

When intended to have the additional device information for the device referenced in a PRT segment in the message, DEV-2 must be equal to PRT-10 Device. When PRT-22 Device Type is used, DEV-3 must be equal.

When communicating a UDI Carrier, the UDI may either be uniquely identifying an instance of a device, or a type of device. This can be asserted based on the inclusion or absence of a serial number in the Product Identifier section of the UDI. When the serial number is present, PRT-10 must be used, while if it is absent, PRT-22 must be used.

When communicating a UDI Carrier in this field, the coding system used is limited to FDA (FDAUDI), HIBCC (HIBUDI), ICCBBA (ICCUDI), and GS1 (GS1UDI) coding systems defined in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70396[HL7 Table 0396].
