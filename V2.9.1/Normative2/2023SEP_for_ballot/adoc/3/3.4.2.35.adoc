Definition: A code representing the taxonomic classification (e.g. species and/or breed) of an organism. This may include the common or scientific name in the description component, based on the coding system(s) used. SNOMED-CT is the recommended coding system. If this field is not valued, a human is assumed. If the specificity of the coding system is insufficient to represent the organism to the degree desired, the most detailed coded value available may be used in this field and additional information sent in the text field, _PID-37 â€“ Strain_.

For example:

...|L-80700^Canine, NOS^SNM3|...

...|L-80100^Bovine^SNM3|...

...|L-80A00^Feline^SNM3|...
