===== 3.6.4.5.1 *Figure 3-2* - Client system assigns identifier, person exists on both systems

The message flow is identical to the message flow in the 3.6.4.5 example, with the exception that the final update to the MPI is not needed in order to give the MPI a new identifier for the person. The MPI should already have the client system identifier from previous transactions.

An ADT event may be sent later by the client system simply to update the MPI with any demographic changes that occur.
