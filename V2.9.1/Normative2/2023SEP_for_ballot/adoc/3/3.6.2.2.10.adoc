|A47 - Change patient identifier list |
|Use Case - The Medical Records Department of XYZ hospital uses a system of manual medical record number assignment. During the admission process, the registrar accidentally assigned the wrong Medical Record Number (MR2 instead of MR1) to ADAM EVERYMAN. Since the correct Medical Record has not yet been assigned to any patient, no merge takes place. The Patient Identifier List is simply changed. |
