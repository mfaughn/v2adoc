|===
|A44 - Move account information - patient account number |
|Use Case - During the admission process, the admitting clerk uses the Medical Record Number of Adam Everyman III (MR1) instead of Adam Everyman, Jr. (MR2). The Patient Administration system assigns the new admission account number ACCT2. When the mistake is discovered, account ACCT2 is moved to the correct Medical Record, MR2. The account number is not changed. |
|Target: _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ and _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ (Note: _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ and _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_ will be the same since the account number does not change in this scenario). |
|Source: _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_ and _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_ (NOTE: _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_ must be valued to indicate which account to move) |

|Implementation considerations: This scenario exists when two medical records legitimately exist for two different people and an account is incorrectly associated with the wrong medical record number. |
