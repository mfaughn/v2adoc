Definition: This field contains a code defining the supervisory level associated with the job of a person recorded in this segment. Supervisory Level reflects the amount of supervisory or management responsibilities for an individual’s job. For example, in the US, in the military, this is the person’s pay grade, which serves as a proxy for supervisory level and can be interpreted across branches. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70956[_HL7 Table 0956 – Supervisory Level Code_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. In the US, this field should use the Job Supervisory Level or Pay Grade (ODH)codes published at https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewCodeSystem.action?oid=2.16.840.1.114222.4.11.7613
