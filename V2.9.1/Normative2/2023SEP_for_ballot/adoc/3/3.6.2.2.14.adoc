|A47 - Change patient identifier list and A49 - Change patient account number |
|Use Case - Patients are automatically assigned Medical Records Numbers and account numbers by hospital XYZ's Patient Administration system at admission. However, when the Patient Administration system is down, the admitting clerk manually assigns account numbers and Medical Records numbers from a pool of downtime numbers. ADAM EVERYMAN was manually assigned downtime Medical Record Number MR1 and downtime account number A1. When the Patient Administration system came back up, the admitting clerk accidentally enters the wrong Medical Record Number (MR2) and account number (X1) into the system. The error occurred because she was reading from the paperwork for a different downtime admit not yet entered into the Patient Administration system. The problem is quickly discovered, and the medical record number and account number was fixed accordingly. Since the other downtime admit had not yet been entered into the Patient Administration system, no merge was required. |
