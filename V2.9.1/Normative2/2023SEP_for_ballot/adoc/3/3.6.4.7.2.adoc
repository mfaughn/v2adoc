===== 3.6.4.7.2 *Figure 3-5* - MPI assigns identifier, person exists on MPI

The message flow is similar to previous examples, with the exception of the _Q24/K24 Allocate Identifiers_ query and the final _A24 Link Patient Information_ message:

*Q24/K24 Allocate Identifiers* - This query is for the client system to ask the MPI for an identifier in the client system's domain. It is not to assign the identifier to a particular person record, but rather just to reserve an identifier for later use.

*A24 Link patient information* - This message is to notify the MPI that the previously allocated identifier has been assigned to a person. The A24 should include one PID segment with the new identifier and one PID segment with the MPI enterprise identifier.
