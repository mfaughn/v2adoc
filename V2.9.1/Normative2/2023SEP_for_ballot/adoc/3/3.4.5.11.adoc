Definition: This field contains the employer's job code and the employee classification used for the next of kin/associated parties at their place of employment. However, if the contact role is the patient's employer, this field contains the job code/class of the patient at their place of employment.

*Note:* The JCC data element appears in other segments as ITEM# 00786 (GT1-50, IN2-47, STF-19). It is assigned a different ITEM# in the NK1 segment because the element name and usage is variable. For example the job code/class can be for the patient's employer, or for an associated party's employment information.
