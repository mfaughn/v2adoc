Definition: This field contains the patient's sex. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70001[_User-defined_ _Table 0001 -_ _Administrative Sex_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

This field has historically been used to variably exchange both sex and gender values and therefore this field is not clearly defined. This field is expected to continue to be used as it has been in existing implementations and use of this field is subject to local existing interpretation and/or implementation guides. The GSP and GSR segments should be used to exchange more rigorously defined sex or gender concept.
