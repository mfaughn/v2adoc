==== *3.6.2.2* Trigger events

The intent of trigger events A40 (merge patient- patient identifier list), A41 (merge account-patient account number), A42 (merge visit-visit number), A43 (move patient information-patient identifier list), A44 (move account information-patient account number), A45 (move visit information-visit number), A47 (change patient identifier list), A49 (change patient account number), A50 (change visit number), and A51 (change alternate visit ID) is to reconcile distinct sets of existing person/patient data records that have been entered under different identification numbers, either deliberately or because of errors. Ideally, following any of these trigger events, all of the person/patient data should be accessible under whatever surviving identifiers were specified in the messages. Because of substantial differences in database architectures and system-dependent data processing requirements or limitations, the exact meaning and implementation of these events must be negotiated between systems.
