== 8.2 PURPOSE

In an open-architecture healthcare environment there often exists a set of common reference files used by one or more application systems. Such files are called master files. Some common examples of master files in the healthcare environment include:

{empty}a) staff and health practitioner master file

{empty}b) system user (and password) master file

{empty}c) location (census and clinic) master file

{empty}d) device type and location (e.g., workstations, terminals, printers, etc.)

{empty}e) lab test definition file

{empty}f) exam code (radiology) definition file

{empty}g) charge master file

{empty}h) patient status master

{empty}i) patient type master

{empty}j) service item master file

These common reference files need to be synchronized across the various applications at a given site. The Master Files Notification message provides a way of maintaining this synchronization by specifying a standard for the transmission of this data between applications.

In many implementations, one application system will "own" a particular master file such as the staff and practitioner master file. The changes (e.g., adds, deletes, updates) to this file are made available to various other applications on a routine basis. The Master Files Notification message supports this common case, but also supports the situation where an application not "owning" a particular master file transmits update information to other systems (usually to the "owning" system) for review and possible inclusion.

The Master Files Notification message supports the distribution of changes to various master files between systems in either online or batch modes, and allows the use of either original or enhanced acknowledgment modes. These messages use the MSH segment to pass the basic event code (master files notification or acknowledgment). The MFI (master file identification) segment identifies the master file being updated as well as the initial and requested dates for "file-level" events (such as "replace file"). For each record being changed, the MFE (Master File Entry) segment carries the record-level event code (such as add, update, etc.), the initial and requested dates for the event, and the record-level key identifying the entry in the master file. The MFA (master file acknowledgment) segment returns record-specific acknowledgment information.

*Note*: The MFE segment is not the master file record, but only specifies its identifier, event, and event dates. The master file record so identified is contained in either Z-segments or HL7-defined segments immediately following the MFE segment. This record may be either a flat record contained in a single segment, or a complex record needing more than a single segment to carry its data and (usually hierarchical) structure.

The master file segments commonly needed across HL7 applications as well as those specific to the various application chapters, are defined in Sections 0 through 4 of this chapter.

A given master files message concerns only a single master file. However, the provision of a record-level event code (and requested activation date) on the MFE and the MFA segments allows a single message to contain several types of changes (events) to that file.

The Master Files Notification events do not specify whether the receiving system must support an automated change of the master file in question, nor do they specify whether the receiving system must create a file in the same form as that maintained on the sending system.

In general, the way in which the receiving system processes the change notification message will depend on both the design of the receiving system and the requirements negotiated at the site. Some systems and/or sites may specify a manual review of all changes to a particular master file. Some may specify a totally automated process. Not every system at every site will need all the fields contained in the master file segment(s) following the MFE segment for a particular master file entry.

This also means that an application acknowledgment (or a deferred application acknowledgment) from a receiving system that it changed a particular record in its version of the master file does not imply that the receiving system now has an exact copy of the information and state that is on the sending system: it means only that whatever subset of that master file's data (and state) that has been negotiated at the site is kept on the receiving system in such a manner that a new Master Files Notification transaction with the same primary key can be applied unambiguously (in the manner negotiated at the site) to that subset of information.

== 8.3 TRIGGER EVENTS

The Master Files Change Notification message can be used for the following message-level trigger events:

[width="100%",cols="19%,81%",options="header",]
|===
|Trigger Event |Name
|M01 |Master File Notification - not otherwise specified [WITHDRAWN]
|M02 |Master File Notification – Staff/Practitioner
|M03 |Master File Notification – Test/Observation [WITHDRAWN]
|M04 |Master File Notification – Charge Description
|M05 |Master File Notification – Patient Location
|M06 |Master File Notification – Clinical Study with Phases and Schedules
|M07 |Master File Notification – Clinical Study without phases but with schedules
|M08 |Master File Notification – Test/Observation (Numeric)
|M09 |Master File Notification – Test/Observation (Categorical)
|M10 |Master File Notification – Test/Observation Batteries
|M11 |Master File Notification – Test/Calculated Observations
|M12 |Master File Notification – Test/Observation – Additional Basic
|M13 |Master File Notification – General
|M14 |Master File Notification – Site Defined
|M15 |Master File Notification – Inventory Item
|M16 |Master File Notification – Inventory Item - Enhanced
|M17 |Master File Notification – DRG
|M18 |Master File Notification – Test/Observation (Payer)
|M19 |Contract Master File
|===

It is recommended that site-specific master files use event M13 or M14; alternately a code of the form Znn can be used (see also section 8.5.1, "MFI - Master File Identification Segment.")

The MFN message specifies whether the master file, as a whole, has been replaced or if a record within the file has been updated. See section link:#_MFI-3___File-Level Event Code   (ID[_8.5.13_&#44; "_MFI-3 File Event Code_]," for further details.

The MFN message transmits the specific action taken on a record. See section link:#_MFE-1___Record-Level Event Code   ([_8.5.2.1_&#44; "_MFE-1 Record Event Code_]," for further details.

== 8.4 MESSAGES

The following messages are defined for master files transactions: MFN, master files notification; MFK, master files application acknowledgment; and MFQ, master files query.

=== 8.4.1 MFN/MFK - Master File Notification [WITHDRAWN] (Event M01) 

*_Withdrawn in version 2.7 and later_*; refer to master file messages which follow.

=== 8.4.2 MFN/MFK - Master File Notification - General (Event M13) 

The MFN General master file notification transaction is used where the master file is a simple one that contains only a key and the text value of that key. Both values are carried in _MFE-4 - Primary Key Value - MFE_. The specific master file being updated is identified by _MFI-1 - Master File Identifier_ and _MFI-2 - Master Files Application Identifier_.

The General master file notification is defined as follows:

The master file record identified by the MFE segment is contained in Z-segments immediately following the MFE segment, and is denoted by "..." in the MFN abstract message definition given above. This record may be either a flat record contained in a single segment, or a complex record needing more than a single segment to carry its data and (usually hierarchical) structure.

The definition of this transaction and the associated abstract message structure code (as defined in _MSH-9 - Message Type_, denoted by MFN_Znn above) are subject to site negotiation. Refer to Chapter 2, section 2.17, "Local Extension" for additional information on 'Z' abstract message structure code definition.

==== 8.4.3.2 MFK use notes

The MFA segment carries acknowledgment information for the corresponding MFE segment (identified by MFA__-5 - Primary Key Value - MFA__). Fields _MFE-4 - Primary Key Value - MFE_ and _MFA-5 - Primary Key Value - MFA_ provide the link between the corresponding segments.

=== 8.4.4 MFQ/MFR - Master Files Query [WITHDRAWN] (Event M01-M17) 

*_Withdrawn in version 2.7 and later_*; refer to Chapter 5 section 5.4 instead. Also, refer to link:#general-master-file-segments[Section 8.4.5] for an example of a master file conformance based query.

Definition: This field is a CWE data type that identifies a standard HL7 master file. This table may be extended by local agreement during implementation to cover site-specific master files (z-master files). HL7 recommends use of the HL7 assigned table number as the master file identifier code if one is not specified in Table 0175. For example, a master file of Marital Status codes would be identified by HL70002 as the _MFI-1 - Master file identifier_. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70175[HL7 Table 0175 – Master File Identifier Code] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

==== 8.5.1.2 MFI-2 Master File Application Identifier (HD) 00659

Components: <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains an optional code of up to 180 characters which (if applicable) uniquely identifies the application responsible for maintaining this file at a particular site. A group of intercommunicating applications may use more than a single instance of a master file of certain type (e.g., charge master or physician master). The particular instance of the file is identified by this field. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70361[User-defined table 0361 - Applications].

*Note*: The replace option allows the sending system to replace a file without sending delete record-level events for each record in that file. UPD means that the events are defined according to the record-level event code contained in each MFE segment in that message.

If the _MFI-3 - File-Level Event Code_ is "REP" (replace file), then each MFE segment must have an _MFE-1 - Record-Level Event Code_ of "MAD" (add record to master file).

==== 8.5.1.4 MFI-4 Entered Date/Time (DTM) 00661

Definition: This field contains the date/time for the file-level event on originating system.

==== 8.5.1.5 MFI-5 Effective Date/Time (DTM) 00662

Definition: This optional field contains the effective date/time, which can be included for file-level action specified. It is the date/time the originating system expects that the event is to have been completed on the receiving system. If this field is not present, the action date/time should default to the current date/time (when the message is received).

==== 8.5.1.6 MFI-6 Response Level Code (ID) 00663

Definition: These codes specify the application response level defined for a given Master File Message at the MFE segment level as defined in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70179[HL7 Table 0179 – Response Level] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables. Required for MFN-Master File Notification message. Specifies additional detail (beyond _MSH-15 - Accept Acknowledgment Type_ and _MSH-16 - Application Acknowledgment Type_) for application-level acknowledgment paradigms for Master Files transactions. _MSH-15 - Accept Acknowledgment Type_ and _MSH-16 - Application Acknowledgment Type_ operate as defined in Chapter 2.

==== 8.5.2.0 MFE Field Definitions

==== 8.5.2.1 MFE-1 Record-Level Event Code (ID) 00664

Definition: This field defines the record-level event for the master file record identified by the MFI segment and the primary key field in this segment. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70180[HL7 Table 0180 - Record Level Event Code] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

*Note:* If the _MFI-3 - File-level event code_ is "REP" (replace file), then each MFE segment must have an _MFE-1 - Record-level event code_ of "MAD" (add record to master file).

==== 8.5.2.2 MFE-2 MFN Control ID (ST) 00665

Definition: A number or other identifier that uniquely identifies this change to this record from the point of view of the originating system. When returned to the originating system via the MFA segment, this field allows the target system to precisely identify which change to this record is being acknowledged. It is only required if the MFI response level code requires responses at the record level (any value other than NE).

*Note:* Note that this segment does not contain a Set ID field. The _MFE-2 - MFN Control ID_ implements a more general concept than the Set ID. It takes the place of the SET ID in the MFE segment.

==== 8.5.2.3 MFE-3 Effective Date/Time (DTM) 00662

Definition: An optional effective date/time can be included for the record-level action specified. It is the date/time the originating system expects that the event is to have been completed on the receiving system. If this field is not present, the effective date/time should default to the current date/time (when the message is received).

==== 8.5.2.4 MFE-4 Primary Key Value - MFE (Varies) 00667

Definition: This field uniquely identifies the record of the master file (identified in the MFI segment) to be changed (as defined by the record-level event code). The data type of field is defined by the value of _MFE-5 - Value Type_, and may take on the format of any of the HL7 data types defined in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70355[HL7 Table 0355 - Primary Key Value Type] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables. The PL data type is used only on Location master transactions. Refer to Table 0608 - Primary Key Value - MFE in Chapter 2C for valid values.

The repetition of the primary key permits the identification of an individual component of a complex record as the object of the record-level event code. This feature allows the Master Files protocol to be used for modifications of single components of complex records. If this field repeats, the field _MFE-5 - Value Type_ must also repeat (with the same number of repetitions), and the data type of each repetition of _MFE-4 - Primary Key Value - MFE_ is specified by the corresponding repetition of _MFE-5 - Value Type_.

==== 8.5.2.5 MFE-5 Primary Key Value Type (ID) 01319 

Definition: This field contains the HL7 data type of _MFE-4 - Primary Key Value - MFE_. The valid values for the data type of a primary key are listed in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70355[HL7 Table 0355 - Primary Key Value Type] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables.

==== 8.5.3.0 MFA Field Definitions

==== 8.5.3.1 MFA-1 Record-Level Event Code (ID) 00664

Definition: This field defines record-level event for the master file record identified by the MFI segment and the primary key in this segment. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70180[HL7 Table 0180 - Record-level Event Code] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

*Note:* If the _MFI-3 - File-level event code_ is "REP" (replace file), then each MFA segment must have an _MFA-1 - Record-level event code_ of "MAD" (add record to master file).

==== 8.5.3.2 MFA-2 MFN Control ID (ST) 00665

Definition: This field contains a number or other identifier that uniquely identifies this change to this record from the point of view of the originating system. This field uniquely identifies the particular record (identified by the MFE segment) being acknowledged by this MFA segment. When returned to the originating system via the MFA segment, this field allows the target system to precisely identify which change to this record is being acknowledged. It is only required if _MFI-6 - Response Level Code_ requires responses at the record level (any value other than NE).

==== 8.5.3.3 MFA-3 Event Completion Date/Time (DTM) 00668

Definition: This field may be required or optional depending on the site specifications for the given master file, master file event, and receiving facility.

==== 8.5.3.4 MFA-4 MFN Record Level Error Return (CWE) 00669

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains the status of the requested update. Site-defined table, specific to each master file being updated via this transaction.

Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70181[User-defined Table 0181 - MFN Record-level Error Return] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. All such tables will have at least the following two return code values: "S" for successful and "U" for unsuccessful.

==== 8.5.3.5 MFA-5 Primary Key Value - MFA (Varies) 01308

Definition: This field uniquely identifies the record of the master file (identified in the MFI segment) for which the update status is being acknowledged (as defined by the field _MFN-4 - Record Level Error Return_). The data type of this field is defined by the value of _MFA-6 - Value Type - MFA_, and may take on the format of any of the HL7 data types defined in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70355[HL7 Table 0355 - Primary Key Value Type] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables. The PL data type is used only on location master transactions. Refer to Table 0607 - Primary Key Value - MFA in Chapter 2C for valid values.

The repetition of the primary key permits the identification of an individual component of a complex record as the object of the record-level event code. This feature allows the Master Files protocol to be used for modifications of single components of complex records. If this field repeats, the field _MFA-6 - Primary Key Value Type - MFA_ must also repeat (with the same number of repetitions), and the data type of each repetition of _MFA-5 - Primary Key Value - MFA_ is specified by the corresponding repetition of _MFA-6 - Value Type - MFA_.

==== 8.5.3.6 MFA-6 Primary Key Value Type - MFA (ID) 01320 

Definition: This field contains the HL7 data type of _MFA-5 - Primary Key Value - MFA_. The valid HL7 data types are listed in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70355[HL7 Table 0355 - Primary Key Value Type] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables.

== 8.6 GENERIC MASTER FILE EXAMPLES

The following are examples of a generic method of updating a standard HL7 table, covering the following two cases:

{empty}1) The case with a site-defined "Z" segment. This message type is used when standard HL7 segments are not available to carry all of the required information on the master file. This message type can also be used in the case where standard HL7 segments are available, but the transaction type is not currently defined by HL7. Refer to Section 8.4.3, "MFN/MFK - Master File Notification - Site Defined (Event M14)," for more information on this message type.

{empty}2) The case without a site-defined "Z" segment. This message type is used when standard HL7 segments are available to carry all of the required information on the master file (in the case of a 'simple' master file that contains only a key and the text value of that key). Refer to Section 8.4.2, "MFN/MFK - Master File Notification - General (Event M13)," for more information on this message type.

The following examples show two records being added to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70006[User-defined Table 0006 - Religion] (in Chapter 2C, Code Tables).

*Note*: A site-defined "Z" table segment ("ZL7" in this example) can be constructed by defining two fields: a table entry field (as a CWE field) and a display-sort-key field (a numeric field) as follows.

=== 8.6.1 ZL7 Segment (Proposed Example Only)

Definition: This field contains HL7 table values for identifier and text encoded as a CWE data type.

==== 8.6.1.2 ZL7-2 Display-Sort-Key (NM)

Definition: This field is used to specify a non-alphabetic ordering for display or print versions of a standard HL7 table.

=== 8.6.2 MFN Message with Original Acknowledgment Mode

==== 8.6.2.0 hiddentext

==== 8.6.2.1 Example message

The initiating system constructs an MFN^M14 message. In this example, the message contains site-defined "Z" segments. The following message is sent to the responding system:

MSH|^~\&|HL7REG|UH|HL7LAB|CH|200106290544||MFN^M14^MFN_Z99|MSGID001|P|2.9

MFI|HL70006^RELIGION^HL70175||UPD|||AL

MFE|MAD|6772332|200106290500|BOT^Buddhist: Other^HL70006|CWE

ZL7|BOT^Buddhist: Other^HL70006|4

The responder receives the message and performs necessary validation on the message. In this example, it determines the message just received is acceptable for processing. The following MFK^M14 message is constructed by the responder and sent to the initiating system to indicate acknowledgment of the MFN^M14 message:

MSH|^~\&|HL7LAB|CH|HL7REG|UH|200106290545||MFK^M14^MFK_M01|MSGID99001|P|2.9

MFA|MAD|6772332|200106290545|S|BOT^Buddhist: Other^HL70006|CWE

Note that _MSA-1 - Acknowledgment Code_ contains 'AA' to indicate the message was received and processed successfully. This value could also have been 'AE' or 'AR' to indicate the message was received but not processed successfully. _MSA-2 - Message Control ID_ contains the value from _MSH-10 - Message Control ID_ in the initiating MFN^M14 message (MSGID001) to link the acknowledgment response to the initiating message.

=== 8.6.3 MFN message with enhanced Mode Application-Level Acknowledgment

==== 8.6.3.0 hiddentext

==== 8.6.3.1 Example message

The initiating system constructs an MFN^M13 message. In this example, the message does not contain site-defined "Z" segments. The following message is sent to the responding system:

MSH|^~\&|HL7REG|UH|HL7LAB|CH|200106290544||MFN^M13^MFN_M13|MSGID004|P|2.9||AL|AL

MFI|HL70006^RELIGION^HL70175||UPD|||AL

MFE|MAD|6772333|200106290500|BUD^Buddhist^HL70006|CWE

MFE|MAD|6772334|200106290500|BOT^Buddhist: Other^HL70006|CWE

The responder receives the message and performs necessary validation on the message. In this example, it determines the message just received is acceptable for processing. Since _MSH-15 - Accept Acknowledgment_ of the initiating message indicates an accept acknowledgment is required ('AL'), the following ACK message is constructed by the responder and sent to the initiating system to indicate acknowledgment of the MFN^M13 message:

MSH|^~\&|HL7LAB|CH|HL7REG|UH|200106290545||ACK^M13^ACK|MSGID99004|P|2.9

MSA|CA|MSGID004

Note that _MSA-1 - Acknowledgment Code_ contains 'CA' to indicate the message was received and committed to safe storage. This value could also have been 'CE' or 'CR' to indicate the message was received but not processed successfully. _MSA-2 - Message Control ID_ contains the value from _MSH-10 - Message Control ID_ in the initiating MFN^M13 message (MSGID004) to link the acknowledgment response to the initiating message.

The initiating system indicated in this example via _MSH-16 - Application Acknowledgment Type_ that it requires an application level acknowledgment ('AL'). The responder, at some point following the sending of the above ACK message to the initiating system, will process the MFN^M13 message. Once message processing is complete, the application acknowledgment is sent from the responder to the initiating system to indicate the message was processed. The responder constructs an MFK^M13 acknowledgment message, and sends it to the initiating system:

MSH|^~\&|HL7LAB|CH|HL7REG|UH|200106290550||MFK^M13^MFK_M13|MSGID99501|P|2.9||AL|

MSA|AA|MSGID004

MFI|HL70006^RELIGION^HL70175||UPD|||AL

MFA|MAD|6772333|200106290550|S|BUD^Buddhist^HL70006|CWE

MFA|MAD|6772334|200106290550|S|BOT^Buddhist: Other^HL70006|CWE

Note that _MSA-1 - Acknowledgment Code_ contains 'AA' to indicate the message was received and processed successfully. This value could also have been 'AE' or 'AR' to indicate the message was received but not processed successfully. This value applies to all MFA segments which follow. _MSA-2 - Message Control ID_ contains the value from _MSH-10 - Message Control ID_ in the initiating MFN^M13 message (MSGID004) to link the application acknowledgment response to the initiating message.

The initiating system receives the application acknowledgment message from the responder, and forms an ACK message to acknowledge it. The following message is sent to the responder system:

MSH|^~\&|HL7REG|UH|HL7LAB|CH|200106290551||ACK^M13^ACK|MSGID445|P|2.9

MSA|CA|MSGID99501

Note that _MSA-2 - Message Control ID_ contains the value from _MSH-10 - Message Control ID_ in the MFK^M13 message just received (MSGID99501), and NOT from the initiating MFN^M13 message.

== 8.7 STAFF AND PRACTITIONER MASTER FILES

=== 8.7.1 MFN/MFK - Staff/Practitioner Master File Message (Event M02) 

The staff identification (STF), person gender and sex (GSP) and recorded, practitioner detail (PRA), practitioner organization unit segment (ORG), professional affiliation (AFF), language detail (LAN), educational detail (EDU), and certificate detail (CER) segments can be used to transmit master files information between systems. The STF segment provides general information about personnel; the GSP, GSR, GSC, PRA, ORG, AFF, LAN, EDU, CER and NTE segments provide detailed information for a staff member.

When the STF, GSP, GSR, GSC, PRA, ORG, AFF, LAN, EDU, CER and NTE segments are used in an MFN message, the abstract definition is as follows:

== 8.8 SERVICE/TEST/OBSERVATIONS MASTER FILES

=== 8.8.1 General Approach of Service/Test/Observation Master Files

These segments define the format for the general information about the observations that a clinical or diagnostic service produces and sends to its "clients." This format can be used to send the producer's entire service/test/observation definition or a few of the producer's observations, such as those with procedure, technique, or interpretation changes.

In anticipation of an object-oriented organization of segments in future releases of this Standard, the attributes of observations/batteries have been grouped into seven different segments:

OM1 contains the attributes that apply to all observations

OM2 applies to numerically-valued observations

OM3 applies to text or code-valued observations

OM4 applies to observations or batteries that require specimens

OM5 contains the attributes of batteries, or sets of observations or other batteries

OM6 contains the quantities (observations in a most general sense) that are calculated from one or more other observations

OM7 contains additional basic attributes that apply to the definition of most observations/services.

Thus, the full definition of a numerically-valued laboratory observation would require the transmission of OM1, OM2, and OM4.

In the following discussion, we use OMx to refer to any of the seven observation-defining segments. Each instance of an OMx segment contains the information about one observation or observation battery. These OMx segments are designed to be "inclusive" and accommodate the attributes of many kinds of observations. Thus, the fact that a field is listed in a particular segment should not be construed as meaning that a producer must include information about that item in its definition transmission. Many fields will apply to some terms; others will not. One observation producer may choose to populate one set of fields; another may choose to populate a different set of fields, according to the requirements of that producer's "client."

Most of the fields of data type TX in those segments are intended to include information typically contained in a diagnostic service's user manual. Such fields should describe how the data is to be interpreted or used, and are not intended for computer interpretation.

Remember that the magnitude of a treatment can also be regarded as an observation and, as such, can be represented as an observation within these segments. Many examples exist. When a blood gas is transmitted, the requesting service usually transmits the amount of inspired O2 (a treatment) on requisition. (In an electronic transmission, the service would send this as an OBX segment, along with the electronic order for the test.) When blood levels are drawn, the amount and time of the last dose are routinely included as observations on the request for service. A pharmacy system could routinely send to a medical record system the average daily dose of each outpatient medication it dispenses. In such cases, the treatment amounts would be observations to the receiving system and would be transmitted as OBX segments. When received, they would be treated like any other observation. A medical record system could then create, for example, a flowchart of lab results, or lab results mixed with relevant treatments.

==== 8.8.9.0 OM1 Field Definitions

==== 8.8.9.1 OM1-1 Sequence Number - Test/Observation Master File (NM) 00586

Definition: This field contains the first OM1 segment in a message and is described as 1, the second as 2, and so on.

==== 8.8.9.2 OM1-2 Producer's Service/Test/Observation ID (CWE) 00587

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains the producer's usual or preferred identification of the test or observation. Only three components should be included: <ID code>^<service text name/description>^<source list of code>. All components should be non-null. Refer to Table 0630 - Producer's Service/Test/Observation ID in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 8.8.9.3 OM1-3 Permitted Data Types (ID) 00588

Definition: This field contains the allowed data type(s) for this observation. The codes are the same as those listed for OBX (a given observation may, under different circumstances, take on different data types). Indeed, under limited circumstances, an observation can consist of one or more fragments of different data types. When an observation may have more than one data type, e.g., coded (CWE) and numeric (NM) the allowable data types should be separated by repeat delimiters. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70125[HL7 Table 0125 – Value Type] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

==== 8.8.9.4 OM1-4 Specimen Required (ID) 00589

Definition: This field contains a flag indicating whether or not at least one specimen is required for the service/test/observation. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70136[HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/no Indicator] as defined in Chapter 2C, Code Tables.

Y one or more specimens are required to obtain this observation

N a specimen is not required

When a specimen is required, segment OM4 will usually be included (one per specimen is required).

==== 8.8.9.5 OM1-5 Producer ID (CWE) 00590

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field uniquely identifies the service producing the observation described in this segment. Three components should be included: an identifying code, the name of the producer, and the identity of the coding system (e.g., 323-5678^Acme Special Lab^MC). The identity of the coding system will usually be MC (Medicare provider number or HIBCC site codes) in the United States. Each country may want to specify its preferred coding system and define a coding system ID to identify it. Refer to Table 0631 - Producer ID in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Remember that the magnitude of a treatment or the setting on a machine, such as a ventilator, can be regarded as an observation. Thus, pharmacy, respiratory care, and nursing may be producers of such observations.

==== 8.8.9.6 OM1-6 Observation Description (TX) 00591

Definition: This field contains all alias codes/identifiers for this observation. If more than one alias code needs to be specified, multiple three-component, CWE-format entries (<code 1>^<name 1>^<code system 1>) may be given, separated by repeat delimiters. An observation may have as many names/codes as are applicable (e.g., ICD9, ACR-NEMA, SNOMED, and READ). We encourage the inclusion of as many different codes as may apply to assist cross-system mapping of terminology. All components of each triplet should be non-null (that is, names and coding system IDs within the CWE data type are required in addition to codes). Refer to Table 0632 - Other Service/Test/Observation IDs for the Observation in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Because the size (dose) of a treatment can also be an observation, codes that identify treatments (e.g., NDC, ICCS) may also be included in this field.

*Note:* In this field, the names within the CWE data type are required.

==== 8.8.9.22 OM1-22 Effective Date/Time of Change (DTM) 00607

Definition: This field contains the date and time of the last change in the test procedure that would make previous results incompatible with new results, e.g., the last time that normal reference range or units changed for a numeric test/observation.

We strongly suggest that observation producers never use the same observation ID when the measurement procedures change in such a way that results produced under the new procedure are clinically different from those produced with the old procedure. Rather, the producer should try to adjust the new procedure so that its values are clinically indistinguishable from the old. Failing that, one should create a new observation ID for the observation produced under the new procedure.

In the rare circumstances when a procedure change occurs and neither of the above two options is viable, this field shall be used to transmit the effective date/time of the new procedure. The receiving system shall assume that any values that come across under this observation ID are under the new procedure after this date and take appropriate steps to distinguish the old from the new observations.

This number is included to provide a means of communicating with the observation producing service when they have questions about particular observations or results.

Definition: This field contains the diagnosis or problem for which the test is a contraindication or of possible danger (e.g., pacemaker, pregnancy, diabetes). For example, if the test identified in OM1 was an intravenous pyelogram, this field would include warnings about the use of contrast media in diabetes. The contraindication diagnoses should be separated by repeat delimiters. Refer to Table 0640 - Contraindications to Observations in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Most contraindication rules will be transmitted as free text. In such cases, the contents serve only as information for human reading. However, an alternative for machine readable contraindication rules also exists.

==== 8.8.9.40 OM1-40 Service/Test/Observation Performance Schedule (ST) 00625

Definition: This field contains the diagnostic studies/tests that are performed only at certain times during the course of a work day or work week. This field indicates the maximum interval between successive test performances (the test may actually be performed more frequently). The format given in Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2.1, "Repeat Pattern," should be used. If necessary, multiple codes may be given, separated by repeat delimiters. The use of multiple codes indicates that the test is performed at multiple concurrent intervals. For example, Q6H indicates that the test is performed at least once every 6 hours around the clock. QJ1 indicates that the test is performed at least every week on Mondays. QAM~QPM indicates that the test is performed at least once every morning and every evening. QJ1~QJ3~QJ5 indicates that the test is performed at least every week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. C indicates that the test is performed continuously, 7 days per week.

Definitions: This optional attribute describes the underlying kind of property represented by this observation. This attribute distinguishes concentrations from total amounts, molar concentrations from mass concentrations, partial pressures from colors, and so forth. These are discussed more fully in the LOINC Users' Manual.footnote:[LOINC Committee. Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes. Indianapolis: Regenstrief Institute and LOINC Committee, 1995.] They are derived from the approach described in 1995 edition of the IUPAC Silver Book.footnote:[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry/International Federation of Clinical Chemistry. The Silver Book: Compendium of terminology and nomenclature of properties in clinical laboratory sciences. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publishers, 1995.] These distinctions are used in IUPAC and LOINC standard codes. Defined categories are listed in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70254[_HL7 Table 0254 - Kind of Quantity_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables.

The distinctions of true quantities in this table are based primarily on dimensional analyses. The table contains a number of "families," those related to simple counts (number, number concentration, etc.), to mass (mass, mass concentration, etc.), to enzyme activity (catalytic content, catalytic concentration, etc.), and molar or equivalents (substance content, substance concentration).

By this classification, a glucose (in the US) would be classed as a mass concentration. A sodium would be classed as a substance concentration. Within the family, a total amount should be described as the unadorned variant; e.g., the property of measure for a patient's weight would be mass, not mass content. Most chemical measures produce concentrations, as exemplified by sodium and glucose. However, a 24-hour urine protein is not a mass concentration, but a mass rate (mass per unit time). The content variants (e.g., mass content, substance content) are used to reflect an amount per mass (usually) of tissue.

This attribute would be valued in a master file only if the service sending the master file classified observations by their principle of measurement.

==== 8.8.9.43 OM1-43 Point Versus Interval (CWE) 00938

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This optional attribute allows master files to classify observations as measuring the patient's state at a point in time (e.g., spot urines, random urines, serum potassium), or averaged over an interval of time (e.g., concentration, total amount, or clearance over a 24-hour collection). Interval measures most often apply to urine and stool specimens (e.g., 24-hour urines, 3-day stool fats). They also apply to clinical measurements such as urine outputs, which are reported as shift totals and 24-hour totals, and event counts on physiologic monitors such as the number of PVCs on a 24-hour Holter monitor.

This field would only be valued in a transaction if the service sending this master file message classified its observation by point versus time interval. This field is *not* used to record the time collection interval for a particular sample. It is used to specify a characteristic of an observation which has a defined normal range and to distinguish observations of the same kind but observed over varying periods of time. A spot urine sodium would have PT stored in this field. A 24-hour urine sodium and a 24-hour Holter monitor would have 24H stored here. This attribute would only be valued if the filling service classified its observations by timing. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70255[User-defined Table 0255 - Duration Categories] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

==== 8.8.9.44 OM1-44 Challenge Information (TX) 00939

Definition: This optional attribute provides information for classifying observations by the challenge component of the test, if a challenge does speciate the observation. For example, distinguishing tests that have a challenge component in database. There co-ascribes the physiologic or drug challenge that is intrinsic to the measurement. To identify, for example, tests that include a glucose challenge.

To construct this text string, use the following template. (Note: This field is not constructed of formally defined components; it is a free text field. Component delimiters are not used and it is not necessary to supply placeholders if some "components" are not used.)

The time delay follows the syntax: n<S|M|H|D|W> where n is a number (possibly a decimal); S denotes seconds; M denotes minutes; H denotes hours; D denotes days; and W denotes weeks. The time delay can be preceded by a 'greater than' (>) sign, e.g. >4H.

file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70256[HL7 Table 0256 - Time Delay Post Challenge] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, lists possible values for time delay.

Examples:

PRE 100 GM GLUCOSE PO

PRE 100 GM GLUCOSE PO

30M POST 100 GM GLUCOSE PO

2H POST 100 GM GLUCOSE PO

TROUGH

For drug peak and trough measures the nature of the substance challenged is the same as the analyte name, and need not be included.

We denote the route of the challenge via abbreviations for medication routes (see Chapter 4A, section 4A.4.2.1, "Route," which references file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70162[HL7 Table 0162 - Route of Administration] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables). An oral route of administration would be denoted by "PO," an intravenous route by "IV."

Details of the drug dose, time the dose was given, route of administration, etc., would be noted in separate OBX, and would have corresponding master observation definitions stored in the observation master file map to different records stored in the master file segments contained in the drug level message.

The nature of a physiologic (non-drug) challenge may also be specified, using the terms in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70257[HL7 Table 0257 - Nature of challenge] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables.

Definition: This optional attribute provides a mechanism for classifying observations according to the subject, in relation to the patient whose results might be stored with as "patient" data. It is standard practice, for example, to report values for controls, donors, and blood product units as well as the patient's own values, and store them in the patient's record. (This may not be the best way to model such information, but it is the way it is usually reported.) This should be valued when two values (e.g., one for patient and one for a blood product unit) could otherwise be confused.

The default value is "Patient," and if not specified, this value is assumed. The persons sub-component can refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70258[HL7 Table 0258 - Relationship Modifier] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values.

Definition: This optional attribute formally indicates the site of the observation (to make it easy for a system to find all tests related to one anatomic site). It can be used to classify the observation by target site of the examination. For example, "heart" might be recorded as the target of the electrocardiogram, cardiac echo, and thallium exercise test. This attribute would be applicable to most imaging and electro-physiologic examinations. The SNOMED topology axis is an example of a coding system for anatomic sites. User-defined tables may also apply here. Refer to Table 0645 - Target Anatomic Site Of Test in Chapter 2C for valid values.

Definition: This optional attribute describes the modality used to acquire the observation data, e.g., radiograph, ultrasound, CT scan, MR, etc. This attribute is especially important for imaging studies. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70910[External Table 0910 – Acquisition Modality] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for the defined value set, which may be repalce or extended with local codes. If the DICOM codes are used, the coding system ID is DCM.

*Note: The use of User-defined Table 0259 - Modality for this field is deprecated and retained for backward compatibility as of v 2.7.*

==== 8.8.9.48 OM1-48 Exclusive Test (ID) 03310

If not populated, the default value of "N" is assumed and that this test can be included with any number of other tests.

When D is specified for this field, using field OM1-49 determines how tests must be grouped together. Tests within the same Diagnostic Service Sector may be on the same requisition, and therefore in the same message.

==== 8.8.9.49 OM1-49 Diagnostic Serv Sect ID (ID) 00257

Definition: This field is the section of the diagnostic service where the observation was performed. If the study was performed by an outside service, the identification of that service should be recorded here.

Definition: The species of living organism. This may include the common or scientific name, based on the coding system(s) used. SNOMED is the recommended coding system. If this field is not valued, a human is assumed. Refer to Table 0661 - Taxonomic Classification Code in Chapter 2C for valid values.

For example:

...|L-80700^Canine, NOS^SNM3|...

...|L-80100^Bovine^SNM3|...

...|L-80A00^Feline^SNM3|....

This field is a list of species or other taxonomic classification(s) to which the indicated specimen type may appropriately be applied for the indicated observation or test. If this field is omitted the default meaning is that the test or observation is applicable to humans. In a veterinary context if the test is applicable to any species, an appropriate code such as "Kingdom Animalia (organism)" should be used to avoid confusion with the meaning of human only.

==== 8.8.9.51 OM1-51 Other Names (recognized by the producer for the observation) (ST) 03399

Definition: This field contains any test aliases or synonyms for the name in the context of the ordering service. These are alternative names, not associated with a particular coding system, by which the battery, test, or observation (e.g., measurement, test, diagnostic study, treatment, etc.) is known to users of the system.

Definition: This field is used to convey gender restrictions for ordering the test specified in OM1-2 Producer's Service/Test/Observation ID. If there are no restrictions the field is left empty. If the test is restricted to order for certain gender(s), the restricted genders are listed. For example, a Prostate Specific AG (PSA) test is typically ordered only for male patients, thus for PSA the field would be valued 'M' for Male.

Note that the field name is historical as gender restriction for procedures and laboratory tests are based upon Sex Parameter for Clinical Use. Refer to User-defined Table 0001 Administrative Sex – or 0828Sex Parameter for Clinical Use in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

==== 8.8.9.59 OM1-59 Age Restriction (NR) 03440

Definition: This field contains the single tests/observations (those with a nature code of A or C, as described in _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_) that have numeric values. This field contains their customary units of measure. Use of UCUM is strongly recommended as one of the specified units (either alone or in addition to the local units).

==== 8.8.10.3 OM2-3 Range of Decimal Precision (NM) 00628

Definition: This field contains the numerically valued single observations (code A or C as described in _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_), specifies the total length in characters of the field needed to display the observation, and the number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal point. This is coded as a single number in the format <length>.<decimal-digits>. For example, a value of 6.2 implies 6 characters total (including the sign and decimal point) with 2 digits after the decimal point. For integer values, the period and <decimal-digits> portion may be omitted (that is, 5.0 and 5 are equivalent). More than one such mask may be transmitted (separated by repeat delimiters) when it is necessary to define multiple display formats that are possible.

Definition: This field contains the single tests/observations - the corresponding SI units of measure in the format, when these differ from the customary units of measure given in the previous field. Refer to Table 0649 - Corresponding SI Units of Measure in Chapter 2C for valid values.

==== 8.8.10.5 OM2-5 SI Conversion Factor (TX) 00630

Definition: This field contains the continuous, numerically valued tests/observations, with a nature code of A or C (see _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_). This is a factor for converting the customary units to SI units.

In the case that the observation units are not SI units, this field provides the formula needed to convert from the reported units to SI units, this shall include the equation needed to convert from the reporting to the SI units.

In the case that the relation is simply multiplicative, this field shall include only the conversion factor. For example, if (results SI units) = c * (results reporting units), then only c would be stored in this field. In the case of any other functional relationship, the entire equation would be stored as a test.

Definition: This field contains the reference (normal) ranges for "numeric" observations/tests with a nature code of A or C (see _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_). It can identify different reference (normal) ranges for different categories of patients according to age, sex, race, and other conditions.

In the first component of this field (Normal Range (NR)), the units are assumed to be identical to the reporting units given in _OM2-2 - Units of Measure_.

When two different methods result in two different reference ranges, two different observations and corresponding OMx segments should be defined.

Definition: This field applies only to single tests/observations (i.e., a nature code of A or C, as described in _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_) with numeric results). When a critical range is defined for such observations, it should be recorded here in the same format as the normal range (see _OM2-6 - Reference (Normal) Range - Ordinal and Continuous Observations_).

Subcomponents for Gestational Age Range (NR): <Low Value (NM)> & <High Value (NM)>

Definition: This field applies only to single tests/observations with a nature code of A or C (see _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_). It defines the range of possible results. Results outside this range are not possible. The field should be recorded in the same format as the normal and critical ranges.

==== 8.8.10.9 OM2-9 Delta Check Criteria (DLT) 00634

Components: <Normal Range (NR)> ^ <Numeric Threshold (NM)> ^ <Change Computation (ID)> ^ <Days Retained (NM)>

Subcomponents for Normal Range (NR): <Low Value (NM)> & <High Value (NM)>

Definition: This field applies to numeric tests/observations with a nature code of A or C (see _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_). The field describes the information that controls delta check warnings and includes four components.

{empty}1) The range to which the following applies: <low & high>. +
All the ranges are defined in terms of the customary reporting units given in _OM2-2 - Units of Measure_. If no value range is given, the check applies to all values.

{empty}2) The numeric threshold of the change that is detected, e.g., 10.

{empty}3) Whether the change is computed as a percent change or an absolute change. This component can have two possible values:

____
% indicates a percent change +
a absolute change
____

{empty}4) The length of time that the service retains a value for computing delta checks. This is recorded in number of days.

____
More than one delta check rule can apply. 13&16^10^%^100~16.1&20^2^a^100 implies that the delta check will trigger on a 10% change when the value of the observation is between 13 and 16. The check will trigger on an absolute change of 2 when the value is between 16.1 and 20. In both cases, the system will keep the last result for 100 days. In this example, beyond 100 days, the computer will not compute a delta check because it will not have a comparison value.

Definition: Certain observations/tests with a nature code of A or C (see _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_) have text (alpha) results (e.g., reactive, nonreactive). Alpha normals for those tests should be entered in this field (e.g., "nonreactive"). Refer to Table 0654 - Normal Text/Codes for Categorical Observations in Chapter 2C for valid values.

The format of this field is:

The first component is a code taken from a standard code source list. The second component is the text associated with the code. The third component is the identification of the code table source. When only a text description of a possible answer is available, it is recorded as ^<text>.

Care should be taken to transmit only those results that are considered normal for that test. A drug screen may have possible results of "negative" and "positive." However, only a result of "negative" is considered to be normal. When an observation has more than one "normal" result, multiple values in this field should be separated with a repeat delimiter.

=== 8.8.12 OM4 - Observations That Require Specimens Segment

The Technical Steward for the OM4 segment is Orders and Observations.

This segment applies to observations/batteries that require a specimen for their performance. When an observation or battery requires multiple specimens for their performance (e.g., creatinine clearance requires a 24-hour urine specimen and a serum specimen), multiple segments may be included, one for each specimen type.

OM4 is a repeating segment. It allows multiple specimens per Order Code and accommodates for multiple alternate specimen for each preferred specimen. In some cases an Order Code can require multiple specimens. In many cases there are preferred specimens and for each preferred it is possible to have one or more alternative specimens. The alternative specimen will carry in OM4-17 the Sequence Number – Test/Observation Master File (OM4-1) of the preferred specimen.

If multiple kinds of specimen are associated with this observation (as in the case for a creatinine clearance), multiple segments may be included, one for each specimen type.

This segment will also allow for reporting Preferred and Alternate specimens, when applicable.

==== 8.8.12.2 OM4-2 Derived Specimen (ID) 00642

Definition: This field contains the codes that identify the parents and children for diagnostic studies—especially in microbiology—where the initial specimen (e.g., blood) is processed to produce results (e.g., the identity of the bacteria grown out of the culture). The process also produces new "specimens" (e.g., pure culture of staphylococcus, and E. coli), and these are studied by a second order process (bacterial sensitivities). The parents (e.g., blood culture) and children (e.g., penicillin MIC) are identified in such cases. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70170[HL7 Table 0170 - Derived Specimen] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values:

Definition: This field contains the physical appearance, including color of tube tops, shape, and material composition (e.g., red-top glass tube). Note that the color is not necessarily a unique identifier of the additive and/or use of the tube. This is especially true for black and some blue tube tops, as can be seen above. Color is included here for user convenience. This field repeats to accommodate all the possible specimen that will be allowed.

Definition: This field contains the codes and names of all tests/observations included within a single battery (nature code P, as described in _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_), a single functional procedure (nature code F), or a given superset (nature code S). When a segment includes a list of component elements, the sending system should be sure that the segments defining all of the components are sent before the segment that references them. An entry in this list can itself be a battery. Refer to Table 0662 - Test/Observations Included Within an Ordered Test Battery in Chapter 2C for valid values.

The individual service/test/observation code should be recorded as type CWE, i.e., in the standard format for coded observation identifiers. Multiple observations should be separated by repeat delimiters. In the US, it is recommended that, within a single occurrence of OM5-2 Tests/Observations included within an Orders Test Battery, these child observations be identified with LOINC codes as well as by the producer’s local identifier. Examples of code systems used may be LOINC (emerging as the global standard for observation identifiers), JLAC10, or SNOMED CT.

If the definition segment defined serum electrolytes, this field might look like the following:

2951-2^SODIUM^LN~

2823-3^POTASSIUM^LN~

2075-0^CHLORIDE^LN~

2028-9^CARBON DIOXIDE^LN

For S (superset) parameters, this field contains the batteries that are included within the "super" battery. For example, ROUTINES might be defined as:

==== 8.8.14.2 OM6-2 Derivation Rule (TX) 00657

Definition: This field is used when there are patient variables that are derived from one or more other patient variables (e.g., creatinine clearance, ideal weight, maximum daily temperature, average glucose, framingham risk). This field contains the rules for deriving the value of this variable (i.e., nature code C, as given in _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_). These can be described in terms of humanly understandable formulas or descriptions.

When possible, however, they should be defined in terms of the Arden Syntax for specifying selection and transcendative functions and algebraic operations, ASTM E1460-92. Derivation rules that are represented in Arden Syntax should begin and end with an Arden slot delimiter (;;). Within this syntax, variables should be identified by _OM1-2 - Producer's Service/Test/Observation ID_. We recommend the use of the Arden Syntax because it permits the unambiguous specification of most such derived values and is a published standard for medical logic modules.

=== 8.8.15 OM7 - Additional Basic Attributes Segment (Fields That Apply to Most Observations/Services)

== 8.9 LOCATION MASTER FILES

=== 8.9.1 MFN/MFK - Patient Location Master File Message (event M05)

This section is specifically concerned with describing a master file message that should be used to transmit information which identifies the inventory of healthcare patient locations, such as nursing units, rooms, beds, clinics, exam rooms, etc. In a network environment, this segment can be used to define patient locations to other applications. The segment also includes the readiness states and support locations for the patient locations.

The LOC, LCH, LRL, LDP, and LCC segments must be preceded by the MFI and MFE segments, as described in Section 8.5, "GENERAL MASTER FILE SEGMENTS." In the following message, the _MFI-1 - Master File Identifier_ field should equal "LOC"

=== 8.9.2 LOC - Location Identification Segment

The Technical Steward for the LOC segment is Patient Administration.

The LOC segment can identify any patient location referenced by information systems. This segment gives physical set up information about the location. This is not intended to include any current occupant or current use information. There should be one LOC segment for each patient location. If desired, there can also be one LOC segment for each nursing unit and room.

=== 8.9.3 LCH - Location Characteristic Segment

The Technical Steward for the LCH segment is Patient Administration.

The LCH segment is used to identify location characteristics which determine which patients will be assigned to the room or bed. It contains the location characteristics of the room or bed identified in the preceding LOC segment. There should be one LCH segment for each attribute.

When the LCH segment appears immediately following the LOC segment, it communicates characteristics which are the same across multiple departments that may use the same room. When the LCH segment appears immediately following the LDP segment, it communicates characteristics which differ for different departments that may use the same room. For example, the following characteristics are more likely to vary by which department is using the room: teaching, gender, staffed, set up, overflow, whereas the other characteristics are likely to remain the same.

When _LRL-4 - Location Relationship ID_ contains "PAR"- Parent, this field holds the value of the parent location to allow for nested entries. For example, a bed entry can point to its containing room or nurse unit. The value for the parent location should match the _LOC-1 - Primary Key Value - LOC_ of the parent entry. Not intended to be used for multiple designations of the same physical location, but for identifying the larger physical locations (supersets) which include this physical location as a subset.

=== 8.9.5 LDP - Location Department Segment

The Technical Steward for the LDP segment is Patient Administration.

The LDP segment identifies how a patient location room is being used by a certain department. Multiple departments can use the same patient location, so there can be multiple LDP segments following an LOC segment. There must be at least one LDP segment for each LOC segment. This is not intended to include any current occupant information.

CHARGE DESCRIPTION MASTER FILES

=== 8.10.1 MFN/MFK - Charge Description Master File Message (Event M04)

The charge description (CDM) master file segment should be used in conjunction with the general master file segments in Section 8.5, "GENERAL MASTER FILE SEGMENTS." Interfacing systems often need not only to communicate data about a patient's detailed charges, but also to communicate the charge identification entries by which an application knows how to handle a particular charge code. The charge description master is a master file.

The NTE segment may also contain other information to the provider to convey other requirements or context. For example:

____
• Convey the status of Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the test. For example, the test may have FDA approval but is not validated yet because of limited gathering of data to confirm the validity of the test.

• Convey that a patient’s consent must be obtained before the test is ordered. This requirement can be conveyed in this NTE as well.
____

The CDM segment below is a specially designed master file segment for interfacing charge description masters. In the following message, the MFI-master file identifier should equal "CDM." When the CDM segment is used in an MFN message, the abstract definition is as follows:

=== 8.10.2 CDM - Charge Description Master Segment

The Technical Steward for the CDM segment is Financial Management.

The CDM segment contains the fields for identifying anything which is charged to patient accounts, including procedures, services, supplies. It is intended to be used to maintain a list of valid chargeable utilization items. Its purpose is to keep billing codes synchronized between HIS, Patient Accounting, and other departmental systems. It is not intended to completely support materials management, inventory, or complex pricing structures for which additional complex fields would be required. Given an identifying charge code, the associated fields in the charge description master file will provide basic pricing and billing data. All the additional information necessary for patient accounting systems to do billing and claims is not intended to be included in this segment; those should be part of insurance or billing profile tables.

The CDM segment contains the fields which, for one chargeable item, remain the same across facilities, departments, and patient types. The following PRC segment contains the fields which, for the same chargeable item, vary depending upon facility or department or patient type.

Definition: This field contains an alternative charge code. For example, points to another charge description master entry in cases where one code supersedes or overrides another code. Repeating field allows for different codes used by different systems which should be handled as if they were the same; for example, the general ledger code may differ from the billing code. Or, in a multi-facility environment which does facility-specific pricing, there may be more than one of these master file entries for one charge description, each with a different facility.

Definition: This field contains the code assigned by the institution for the purpose of uniquely identifying the thing that can be charged. The key field of the entry. For example, this field would be used to uniquely identify a procedure, item, or test for charging purposes. Probably the same set of values as used in _FT1-7 - Transaction Code_ in financial messages. Must match _MFE-4 - Primary Key - MFE_ and _CDM-1 - Primary Key - CDM_. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70132[User-defined Table 0132 - Transaction code] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. See Chapter 7 for discussion of the universal service ID.

==== 8.10.3.2 PRC-2 Facility ID - PRC (CWE) 00995

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: This field contains the facility of the institution for which this price (for the preceding CDM entry) is valid. For use when needing multi-facility pricing. If null, assume all facilities. In a multi-facility environment, the facility associated with this chargeable item may not be the same as the sending or receiving facility identified in the MSH segment. Use only when the price is not the same for all facilities, that is, a null value indicates that this pricing is valid for all facilities.

When two PRC segments are sent with the same key values but different facility identifiers, the second is sent in addition to the first, not to replace the first. The effective unique identifier is the charge code (_PRC-1 - Primary Key Value - PRC_) plus the facility ID (_PRC-2 - Facility ID_). Multiple facility identifiers can be sent in the same segment to indicate that those facilities use the same pricing. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70464[User-defined Table 0464 - Facility ID] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

Definition: This field contains the department of the facility which accrues revenue/cost for this type of charge. When pricing is different for different departments within the same facility, this will indicate for which department the following pricing information is valid. Use only when the price is not the same for all departments, that is, a null value indicates that this pricing is valid for all departments.

When two PRC segments are sent the same key values but with different departments, the second is sent in addition to the first, not to replace the first. The effective unique identifier is the charge code _(PRC-1 - Primary Key - PRC_) plus the facility ID (_PRC-2 - Facility ID_) plus the department (_PRC-3 - Department_). Multiple departments can be sent in the same segment to indicate that those departments use the same pricing. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70184[User-defined Table 0184 - Department] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

Definition: This field contains the patient types for which this charge description is valid. For example, Inpatient, Outpatient, Series, Clinic, ER, Ambulatory, Observation, etc. These values should be the same set of values as those used for _PV1-3 - Patient Class_, which is site defined. Use only when the price is not valid for all patient types, that is, a null value indicates that this pricing is valid for all patient classes. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70004[User-defined Table 0004 - Patient Class] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

When two PRC segments are sent the same key values but with different valid patient classes, the second is sent in addition to the first, not to replace the first. The effective unique identifier is the charge code (_PRC-1 - PRC Primary Key_) plus the facility ID (_PRC-2 - Facility ID_) plus the department (_PRC-3 - Department_) plus the patient class (_PRC-4 - Valid Patient Classes_). Multiple patient classes can be sent in the same segment to indicate that those patient classes use the same pricing.

== 8.12 INVENTORY ITEM MASTER FILES

=== 8.12.1 MFN/MFK - Inventory Item Master File Message (Event M15)

This section is concerned with describing a master file message that should be used to communicate information that relates to the inventory of items that can be used to perform an ordered service. While an order specifies a service that is represented in an Other Observation/Service Item master file, this message is concerned with communicating attributes of those orderable items (for example lot number and expiration date) that are represented in the Other Observation/Service Item master file. These attributes are more granular than can be represented in the Other Observation/Service Item master file as there may be multiple items in inventory that meet the characteristics of the Service Item but have different specific characteristics, e.g., multiple lots of a vaccine.

Each MFE/IIM structure describes a specific set of lot, expiration date, location, etc. for a Service Item. Multiple instances of MFE/IIM could be used to describe the same Service Item lot at multiple locations, or a location with multiple lots of the same Service Item.

This message is not intended to act as a complete inventory management system. Various inventory management concepts, e.g., PAR levels, invoice and purchase order tracking, are intentionally not supported. The message is intended to synchronize limited orderable item attributes, e.g., quantity on hand, lot number, expiration date, between communicating systems. Such systems may include a Pharmacy Application and a Nurse-based dispensing system. While the Pharmacy application may define the service items (communicated in [MFN^M12^MFN_12] Other Observation/Service Item master file Messages), the dispensing system would communicate the lot numbers, expiration date and quantity on hand for service items in inventory using the Inventory Item Master file message.

*Note*: The IIM segment has been moved to Chapter 17.

=== 8.12.2 MFN/MFK - Inventory Item Master File Message – Enhanced (Event M16)

This section describes a master file message designed to communicate information that relates to the sharing of material item master catalog and material item-inventory information between materials management systems and other systems such as surgical and immunization systems. The synchronization of the "item master" between systems and across the enterprise enables the success of the subsequent interfacing of transactions such as: material item requisitions (pre and post case), accounts payable invoices for the payment of material items, journal entries generated from the issue of items to departments or other inventory locations, and patient charges that allow a customer to improve patient care through the better management of materials. To face budget challenges, healthcare organizations need materials management systems that integrate with finance to automate logistics, eliminate paperwork and analyze data to improve efficiency and reduce overall costs. This process is a major contributor to improving the customers' bottom line by helping to eliminate materials waste, streamline ordering, ensure accurate payment of materials purchased, ensure accurate billing for materials used, and an accurate presentation of the financial statements of a healthcare facility.

Material items defined in this message include consumable supplies, devices, surgical sets, and implants.

Each MFE/ITM structure describes a set of attributes, specific to a material item existing in an item master catalog. The PCE and NTE segments are optional and repeating, associated with the item referred to in the ITM segment. An item may be linked to many patient charge exception combinations.

Each VND/PKG segment grouping includes the available vendors and packaging information valid for the item referred to in the ITM segment. An item may be associated with many vendors. A vendor may be linked to many packaging configurations. Therefore the vendor segment can repeat and can include a repeating PKG segment within each repetition of the vendor segment.

Each MFE/ITM/IVT structure describes a set of attributes specific to the inventory locations associated with the item referred to in the associated ITM segment. An inventory item can exist in more than one inventory location with different values for the same attributes, therefore, this segment repeats.

The ILT segment describes lot and quantity information for a material product. In the message structure, this segment is directly associated with the IVT segment, thus the lot/quantity information is always related to a location. Repetition of the ILT segment supports the case where more than one lot of a material product may exist in an inventory location.

Note that the quantities in the ILT segment are not necessarily intended to refer to continuously updated inventory quantities. The expectation is that periodic inventory quantities would be updated with subsequent master file messages. This segment can be used for interfacing, for example, Immunization information.

Additional specialized information segments may be defined as additional use cases are defined, such as medication/drug segments.

Components: <Low Value (NM)> ^ <High Value (NM)>

Components: <Lower Trim Point (NM)> ^ <Upper Trim Point (NM)>

Definition: This field contains the lower and upper trim points as calculated for this DRG..

Example as used in Germany: The "lower trim point" is equivalent to 1/3 of the average length of stay for patients having this DRG. The "upper trim point" is equivalent to 3 times the average length of stay. It is marked as the right dotted line within the graphics below.

The following graphics provides an overview of the German usage:

image:extracted-media/media/image1.wmf[extracted-media/media/image1]

The gray boxes represent the amount of cases according to the length of stay. The higher and lower 2,5% outliers (white boxes) are cut off. The average length of stay is calculated thereof and is represented by the middle dotted line. From that the lower trim point is calculated by dividing by 3, the upper trim point is the average multiplied with 3.

=== 8.15.1 Master file update examples: with original and enhanced acknowledgment protocol

This example shows the lab system using the Master Files specification to send two update test dictionary entries to an ICU system. The OM1 (observation dictionary) segment, currently under development by HL7 and ASTM, carries the dictionary information. Several varieties of acknowledgement are shown. The choice of acknowledgment mode is site-specific.
