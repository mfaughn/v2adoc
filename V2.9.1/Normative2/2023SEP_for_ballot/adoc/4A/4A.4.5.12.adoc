Definition: This field contains the total daily dose being dispensed as expressed in terms of the actual dispense units.

*Note:* The next two fields are equivalent to the corresponding fields of the RXE segment. They are included (optionally) in the RXD so that it may "stand alone" as a dispense result instruction segment.
