Definition: This field contains the units for the give amount as encoded by the pharmacy or treatment (e.g., respiratory therapy) application. Refer to Table 0715 - Give Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

*Note:* These units can be a "compound quantity"; i.e., the units may contain the word "per." For example, micrograms per KG (micg/kg) is an acceptable value, which means that the units are micrograms per KG (of body weight).

A table of standard units that contains compound units is needed. Until such a table is agreed on, a user-defined table is needed for each site.
