This is the same as the format specified for the DURATION component of the quantity/timing field, excluding the "X" specification.

Required when relevant (e.g., certain IVs). For example, if the "give amount/units" were 300 ml and the "give per" time unit were H1 (equivalent to one hour), the rate is 300ml/hr.
