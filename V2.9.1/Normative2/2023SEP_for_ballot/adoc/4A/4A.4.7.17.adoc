Definition: This field contains the manufacturer of the medical substance administered.

*Note:* For vaccines, code system MVX may be used to code this field. See section _4A.7.1_, "_Vaccine administration data_." This field may be used if the manufacturer of the substance is not identified by the code used in RXA-5- administered code. When using this code system to identify vaccines, the coding system component of the CWE field should be valued as "MVX", not as "HL70227."
