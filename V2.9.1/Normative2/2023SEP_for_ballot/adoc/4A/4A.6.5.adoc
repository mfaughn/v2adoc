=== 4A.6.5 RAS:

The Nursing application (and other applications) can generate the RAS, the pharmacy/treatment Administration Results message, whenever a medication is given to the patient. This message may occur multiple times for each order.

*Note:* Sites having a long term clinical data repository may wish to route data to the data repository from copies of all or any of the five messages.
