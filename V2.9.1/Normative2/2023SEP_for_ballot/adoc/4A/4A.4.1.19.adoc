Definition: Required when both _RXO-1-requested give code_ and _RXO-10-requested dispense code_ do not specify the strength; optionally included otherwise. This is the unit of the strength, used in combination with _RXO-18-requested give strength_. Refer to Table 0756 - Requested Give Strength Units in Chapter 2C for valid values.

*Note:* These units can be a "compound quantity;" i.e., the units may express a quantity per unit of time. For example, micrograms per hour (micg/h) is an acceptable value. These compound units are contained in the ISO+ table. See Chapter 7 for full definition of ISO+ units.
