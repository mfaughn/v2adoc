==== 4A.4.6.5 RXG-5 Give Amount â€“ Minimum (NM) 00318

Definition: This field contains the ordered amount as encoded by the pharmacy/treatment supplier. In a variable dose order, this is the minimum ordered amount. In a non-varying dose order, this is the exact amount of the order.

*Note:* This field is not a duplication of the first component of the quantity/timing field, since in non-pharmacy/treatment orders, that component can be used to specify multiples of an ordered amount.

Another way to say this is that, for pharmacy/treatment orders, the quantity component of the quantity/timing field refers to what is to be given out at each service interval; and thus, in terms of the RX order, that first component always defaults to 1. Hence, in the actual execution of the order, the value of 1 in the first component of the quantity/timing field always refers to one administration of the amount specified in this field (the requested Give Amount field).
