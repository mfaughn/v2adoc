== 3.2 Purpose

The Patient Administration transaction set provides for the transmission of new or updated demographic and visit information about patients. Since virtually any system attached to the network requires information about patients, the Patient Administration transaction set is one of the most commonly used.

Generally, information is entered into a Patient Administration system and passed to the nursing, ancillary and financial systems either in the form of an unsolicited update or a response to a record-oriented query.

This chapter defines the transactions that occur at the seventh level, that is, the abstract messages. The examples included in this chapter were constructed using the HL7 Encoding Rules.

== 3.3 Trigger Events and Message Definitions

=== 3.3.1 ADT/ACK - Admit/Visit Notification (Event A01)

An A01 event is intended to be used for "Admitted" patients only. An A01 event is sent as a result of a patient undergoing the admission process which assigns the patient to a bed. It signals the beginning of a patient's stay in a healthcare facility. Normally, this information is entered in the primary Patient Administration system and broadcast to the nursing units and ancillary systems. It includes short stay and "Adam Everyman" (e.g., patient name is unknown) admissions. For example, an A01 event can be used to notify: the pharmacy system that a patient has been admitted and may be legitimately prescribed drugs; the nursing system that the patient has been admitted and needs a care plan prepared; the finance system of the start of the billing period; the dietary system that a new patient has been installed and requires dietary services; the laboratory, pathology, and radiology systems that a patient has been admitted and is entitled to receive services; the clinical repository that an admission has taken place for the EMR (electronic medical record).

When an account's start and end dates span a period greater than any particular visit, the P01 (add patient account) event should be used to transmit the opening of an account. The A01 event can notify systems of the creation of an account as well as notify them of a patient's arrival in the healthcare facility. In order to create a new account without notifying of patient's arrival, use the P01 event.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT – Participation Information Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin and end date of the provider, use the _–PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _–PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT segment, with the applicable _PRT-4 – Role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

=== 3.3.2 ADT/ACK - Transfer a Patient (Event A02)

An A02 event is issued as a result of the patient changing his or her assigned physical location.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition. If the transfer function of your Patient Administration system allows demographics to change at the same time as the transfer (for example an address change), we recommend (but do not require) sending two messages (an A02 followed by an A08). This A02 event can be used with admitted and non-admitted patients.

The new patient location should appear in _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_ while the old patient location should appear in _PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location_. For example, an A02 event can be used to notify: laboratory, radiology, pathology that the patient has changed location and test results should be redirected; pharmacy that drugs should be redirected for the patient; dietary that the meals should be delivered to a different location; the clinical repository that a transfer has taken place for the Electronic Medical Record.

If the patient is going to a temporary location (such as the O/R, X-RAY, LIMBO, the HALLWAY) it is recommended that the A09 (patient departing-tracking) and A10 (patient arriving-tracking) events be used instead of A02. It is recommended that A02 be used only for a real change in the census bed in the Patient Administration system.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT – Participation Information Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the _–PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _–PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT segment, with the applicable _PRT-4 – Role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

=== 3.3.3 ADT/ACK - Discharge/End Visit (Event A03)

An A03 event signals the end of a patient's stay in a healthcare facility. It signals that the patient's status has changed to "discharged" and that a discharge date has been recorded. The patient is no longer in the facility. The patient's location prior to discharge should be entered in _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_.

An A03 event can be sent to notify: the pharmacy that the patient's stay has ended and that entitlement to drugs has changed accordingly; the nursing system that the patient has been discharged and that the care plan can be completed; the extended care or home health system that the patient has been discharged and that the new extended care or home health admission assessment can be scheduled; the finance system that the patient billing period has ended; and/or the clinical repository that discharge has taken place for the EMR.

For non-admitted patients, an A03 event signals the end of a patient's visit to a healthcare facility. It could be used to signal the end of a visit for a one-time or recurring outpatient who is not assigned to a bed. It could also be used to signal the end of a visit to the Emergency Room. _PV1-45 - Discharge Date/Time_ can be used for the visit end date/time.

When an account's start and end dates span a period greater than any particular visit, the P06 (end account) event should be used to transmit information about the closing of an account. To indicate that a patient has expired, use an A03 event with the _PID-29 - Patient Death Date and Time_ and _PID-30 - Patient Death Indicator_ filled in.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. The optional allergy, next-of-kin, insurance and guarantor fields should be sent when required to support advanced notification for pending extended care or home health admission requirements (such as scheduling of a nursing assessment in preparation for completion of the extended care plan). When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

=== 3.3.4 ADT/ACK - Register a Patient (Event A04)

An A04 event signals that the patient has arrived or checked in as a one-time, or recurring outpatient, and is not assigned to a bed. One example might be its use to signal the beginning of a visit to the Emergency Room (= Casualty, etc.).

*Note:* Some systems refer to these events as outpatient registrations or emergency admissions. _PV1-44 - Admit Date/Time_ is used for the visit start date/time.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT - Participation Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRTsegment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the _–PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _–PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT segment, with the applicable _PRT-4 – role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

=== 3.3.5 ADT/ACK - Pre-Admit a Patient (Event A05)

An A05 event is sent when a patient undergoes the pre-admission process. During this process, episode-related data is collected in preparation for a patient's visit or stay in a healthcare facility. For example, a pre-admit may be performed prior to inpatient or outpatient surgery so that lab tests can be performed prior to the surgery. This event can also be used to pre-register a non-admitted patient.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT - Participation Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Visit level providers (corresponding to the PV1 data) are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the _–PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _–PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT segment, with the applicable _PRT-4 – Role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 15 for the definition of the PRT segment.

=== 3.3.6 ADT/ACK - Change an Outpatient to an Inpatient (Event A06)

An A06 event is sent when a patient who was present for a non-admitted visit is being admitted after an evaluation of the seriousness of the patient's condition. This event changes a patient's status from non-admitted to admitted. The new patient location should appear in _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_, while the old patient location (if different) should appear in _PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location_. The new patient class should appear in _PV1-2 - Patient Class_.

It will be left to implementation negotiation to determine whether disparate systems merely change the patient class, or close and open a new account. The current active account number should appear in field _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_; the prior account number can be included optionally in _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_. This arrangement is not intended to be a type of merge. The MRG segment is used here only for _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_. _PV1-19 - Visit Number_ may also be changed during this event.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT – Participation Information Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments.

An A07 event is sent when a patient who was admitted changes his/her status to "no longer admitted" but is still being seen for this episode of care. This event changes a patient from an "admitted" to a "non-admitted" status. The new patient location should appear in _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_, while the old patient location (if different) should appear in _PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location_.

It will be left to implementation negotiation to determine whether disparate systems merely change the patient class, or close and open a new account.

=== 3.3.8 ADT/ACK - Update Patient Information (Event A08)

This trigger event is used when any patient information has changed but when no other trigger event has occurred. For example, an A08 event can be used to notify the receiving systems of a change of address or a name change. We strongly recommend that the A08 transaction be used to update fields that are [.underline]#not# updated by any of the other trigger events. If there are specific trigger events for this update, these trigger events should be used. For example, if a patient's address and location are to be changed, then an A08 is used to change the patient address and the appropriate patient location trigger event is used to change the patient location. The A08 event can include information specific to an episode of care, but it can also be used for demographic information only.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT – Participation Information Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the _PRT-11 – Begin Date/Time_ and the _–PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT, with the applicable _PRT-4 – role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

=== 3.3.9 ADT/ACK - Patient Departing - Tracking (Event A09)

The A09 and A10 - patient arriving-tracking events are used when there is a change in a patient's physical location (inpatient or outpatient) and when this is NOT a change in the official census bed location, as in the case of an outpatient setting. There are three situations that qualify as non-census location changes: (a) patient tracking, (b) the patient is in transit between locations for some time, (c) a notification of temporary location change.

Patient tracking: This can be used when the nursing application sends a "transfer" before the Patient Administration (or official census) system issues an A02 (transfer a patient) event. If the patient has left for a non-temporary location and is not in transit, then the _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_ must contain the new patient location, while _PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location_ must contain the old patient location.

In transit: The patient's location during the time between an A09 and an A10 (patient arriving - tracking) is defined as "in transit." The A09 event is sent when a patient departs from one area of the healthcare facility for the purpose of arriving at another area, but without leaving the healthcare institution. This event is used when there is a time span during which the patient is neither at his/her old location nor at his/her new location. This process can take some time if a patient is being sent to another area in a multi-campus or multi-facility environment. The combination of an A09 and an A10 would serve the same purpose as an A02 (transfer a patient) event, except that it accounts for a gap in time required for transport between facilities. If the patient will be in transit during the time between the A09 (patient departing - tracking) event and the A10 (patient arriving - tracking) event, then _PV1-42 - Pending Location_ is used for the new location, and _PV1-11 - Temporary Location_ and _PV1-43 - Prior Temporary Location_ would not be used. _PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location_ should be used for the old location.

Temporary location: An A09 can also be used when the patient is being sent to a temporary location (such as the O/R, X-RAY, LIMBO, or HALLWAY). The patient may or may not return to the same assigned location after occupying the temporary location. If the patient is going to a temporary location (such as the O/R, X-RAY, LIMBO, or HALLWAY), then _PV1-11 - Temporary Location_ is used to indicate the new temporary location. If the patient is moving from one temporary location to another, then _PV1-43 - Prior Temporary Location_ may also be used. _PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location_ and _PV1-11 - Temporary Location_ should be used when the patient is moving from a permanent location to a temporary location.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

=== 3.3.10 ADT/ACK - Patient Arriving - Tracking (Event A10)

The A10 event is sent when a patient arrives at a new location in the healthcare facility (inpatient or outpatient). The A09 - patient departing-tracking and A10 events are used when there is a change in a patient's physical location and when this is NOT a change in the official census bed location, as in the case of an outpatient setting. There are three varieties of these non-census location changes involving three different kinds of notification: (a) an unofficial notification of location change prior to the official notification of patient tracking, (b) the patient is in transit between locations for some time, (c) a notification of a temporary location change.

Patient tracking: If the patient is now at a non-temporary location and is not in transit, then _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_ must contain the new patient location and _PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location_ can contain the old patient location.

In transit: This is used when there is some period of time between when the patient leaves his/her old location and when he/she arrives at the new assigned location. If the patient was in transit during the time between the A09 (patient departing-tracking) event and the A10 (patient arriving-tracking) event, then _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_ is used for the new location and _PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location_ should be used for the old location. _PV1-11 - Temporary Location_ and _PV1-43 - Prior Temporary Location_ are not used.

Temporary location: An A10 event can also be used when the patient is being transferred from a temporary location (X-RAY, O/R, LIMBO, or HALLWAY) to the new assigned location. If the patient is arriving at a temporary location (such as the O/R, X-RAY, LIMBO, or HALLWAY), then _PV1-11 - Temporary Location_ would be used to indicate the new temporary location. If the patient is moving from one temporary location to another, then _PV1-43 - Prior Temporary Location_ may also be used. If the patient is arriving at a permanent location from a temporary location, _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_ should be used for the new location, and _PV1-43 - Prior Temporary Location_ should be used for the old location.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

=== 3.3.11 ADT/ACK - Cancel Admit / Visit Notification (Event A11)

For "admitted" patients, the A11 event is sent when an A01 (admit/visit notification) event is cancelled, either because of an erroneous entry of the A01 event, or because of a decision not to admit the patient after all.

For "non-admitted" patients, the A11 event is sent when an A04 (register a patient) event is cancelled, either because of an erroneous entry of the A04 event, or because of a decision not to check the patient in for the visit after all. To cancel an A05 (pre-admit a patient) event, use the A38 (cancel pre-admit), which was new for Version 2.3 of this Standard.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

=== 3.3.13 ADT/ACK - Cancel Discharge / End Visit (Event A13)

The A13 event is sent when an A03 (discharge/end visit) event is cancelled, either because of erroneous entry of the A03 event or because of a decision not to discharge or end the visit of the patient after all. _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_ should reflect the location of the patient after the cancellation has been processed.

*Note:* This location may be different from the patient's location prior to the erroneous discharge. Prior Location could be used to show the location of the patient prior to the erroneous discharge.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

The PRT - Participation Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the _–PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _–PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the ROL, with the applicable _PRT-4 – Role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

=== 3.3.14 ADT/ACK - Pending Admit (Event A14)

An A14 event notifies other systems of a planned admission, when there is a reservation or when patient admission is to occur imminently. The A14 event is similar to a pre-admit, but without the implication that an account should be opened for the purposes of tests prior to admission. It is used when advanced notification of an admit is required in order to prepare for the patient's arrival.

The PRT - Participation Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the _–PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _–PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT, with the applicable _PRT-4 – Role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

=== 3.3.15 ADT/ACK - Pending Transfer (Event A15)

An A15 event notifies other systems of a plan to transfer a patient to a new location when the patient has not yet left the old location. It is used when advanced notification of a transfer is required in order to prepare for the patient's location change. For example, this transaction could be sent so that staff will be on hand to move the patient or so that dietary services can route the next meal to the new location.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT - Participation Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the _PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT segment, with the applicable _PRT-4 – Role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

*Attention: The DG1 segment was retained in this message for backward compatibility only as of v2.4 and was withdrawn and removed from this message structure as of v2.7.*

=== 3.3.16 ADT/ACK - Pending Discharge (Event A16)

An A16 event notifies other systems of a plan to discharge a patient when the patient has not yet left the healthcare facility. It is used when advanced notification of a discharge is required in order to prepare for the patient's change in location. For example, it is used to notify the pharmacy of the possible need for discharge drugs or to notify psychotherapy of the possible need for post-discharge appointments or to notify the extended care or home health system that the patient will be discharged and that the new extended care and home health admission assessment can be scheduled.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

=== 3.3.21 ADT/ACK - Patient Goes on a Leave of Absence (Event A21)

An A21 event is sent to notify systems that an admitted patient has left the healthcare institution temporarily. It is used for systems in which a bed is still assigned to the patient, and it puts the current admitted patient activities on hold. For example, it is used to notify dietary services and laboratory systems when the patient goes home for the weekend.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

As there is no specific field for the LOA start date/time, it is recommended field _EVN-6 - Event Occurred_ contain the date/time the patient actually left. _PV2-47 - Expected LOA Return Date/Time_ is used to communicate the date/time the patient is expected to return from LOA.

=== 3.3.22 ADT/ACK - Patient Returns From a Leave of Absence (Event A22)

An A22 event is sent to notify systems that an admitted patient has returned to the healthcare institution after a temporary "leave of absence." It is used for systems in which a bed is still assigned to the patient, and it takes their current admitted patient activities off of "hold" status. For example, it is used to notify dietary services and laboratory systems when the patient returns from a weekend trip to his/her home.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

As there is no specific field for the LOA start date/time, it is recommended that field _EVN-6 - Event Occurred_ contain the date/time the patient actually returned from LOA. _PV2-47 - Expected LOA Return Date/Time_ is used to communicate the date/time the patient was expected to return from LOA.

=== 3.3.23 ADT/ACK - Delete a Patient Record (Event A23)

The A23 event is used to delete visit or episode-specific information from the patient record. For example, it is used to remove old data from a database that cannot hold all historical patient visit data. When an event was entered erroneously, use one of the cancel transactions. This event can be used to purge account-level data while retaining the person in the database.

=== 3.3.24 ADT/ACK - Link Patient Information (Event A24)

The A24 event is used when the first PID segment needs to be linked to the second PID segment and when both patient identifiers identify the same patient. Linking two or more patients does not require the actual merging of patient information; following a link event, the affected patient data records should remain distinct. For example, this event could be used in a hospital network environment in which there are multiple campuses and in which records need to be linked. For example, hospital A, hospital B, and hospital C would each keep their own records on a patient, but an A24 link event would be sent to a corporate-wide MPI to enable the coupling of ID information with the corporate ID number. It is used for corporate data repositories, etc. This event is not meant to link mothers and babies since a field exists (_PID-21 - Mother's Identifier_) for that purpose. See section link:#patient-record-links[_3.6.3_], "_link:#patient-record-links[Patient record links],_" for a discussion of issues related to implementing patient link messages and MPI issues.

This event can also be used to link two patient identifiers when a patient changes from inpatient to outpatient, or vice versa. This event can also be used to link two visits of the same patient.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

=== 3.3.28 ADT/ACK - Add Person or Patient Information (Event A28)

The purpose of this and the three following messages was to allow sites with multiple systems and respective master patient databases to communicate activity related to a person regardless of whether that person is currently a patient on each system. Each system has an interest in the database activity of the others in order to maintain data integrity across an institution. Though they are defined within the ADT message set, these messages differ in that they are not patient-specific. To a certain registry, the person may be a person of interest, a potential future patient, or a potential guarantor. For example, these events can be used to maintain an MPI (master patient index), a cancer registry, members of a managed care plan, an HIV database, etc.

These events should not replace the use of the A01 (admit/visit notification), A03 (discharge/end visit), A04 (register a patient), A08 (update patient information), etc., events. They are not intended to be used for notification of real-time Patient Administration events. These events are primarily for demographic data, but optional historical non-demographic data may be sent as well.

The person whose data is being sent should be identified in the PID segment using the _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_, even when the person is not a patient and may be a potential guarantor. An A28 establishes person identifiers, e.g., social security number, guarantor identifier, or other unique identifiers, and contains a person identifier in the _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_. The person involved may or may not have active or inactive cases associated with them. When field names and descriptions say "patient," we must translate that to "person" for these transactions. In this manner, "person information" about a guarantor can be sent independently of the guarantor's relation to any patient.

For example, a site with separate inpatient, outpatient and medical records systems may require that each system maintain concurrent person information. Prior to an admit, the new person is added to the master database of the inpatient system, resulting in the broadcast of a message. The outpatient system receives the message and adds the person to its database with the possibility that the person may someday become a patient in its system. The medical records system receives the message and adds the person to its database with the possibility that it will track inpatient, outpatient, or clinical data for that person. The clinical repository database or MPI receives the message to keep all potential patients and guarantors in its database.

The A28 event can be used to send everything that is known about a person. For example, it can be sent to an ICU unit (in addition to the A02 (transfer a patient) event) when a patient is transferred to the ICU unit in order to backload all demographic information for the patient into the ICU system. An A28 (add person information) or A31 (update person information) can also be used for backloading MPI information for the person, or for backloading person and historical information.

In addition to adding a person to a database, the delete, update, and merge messages work in a similar manner to maintain concurrent person information. It is left up to site-specific negotiations to decide how much data must be transmitted or re-transmitted when a person becomes a patient.

To maintain backward compatibility with previous releases, the PV1 segment is required. However, a "pseudo-optional" PV1 can be achieved by valuing _PV1-2 - Patient Class_ to N - not applicable.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT – Participation Information Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin and end date of the provider, use the _PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT, with the applicable _PRT-4 – Role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

=== 3.3.29 ADT/ACK - Delete Person Information (Event A29)

An A29 event can be used to delete all demographic information related to a given person. This event "undoes" an A28 (add person information) event. The information from the A28 event is deleted. This event is used, for example, when adding the information was performed in error, or when another record already exists for the person, or when one wants to purge the person from the database. When this event occurs, all visit and account level data for this person is also purged.

To maintain backward compatibility with previous releases, the PV1 segment is required. However, a "pseudo-optional" PV1 can be achieved by valuing _PV1-2 - Patient Class_ to N - not applicable.

=== 3.3.30 ADT/ACK - Merge Person Information (Event A30)

*Attention: The Merge Person Information event was maintained for backward compatibility only as of v2.3.1 and withdrawn as of v2.7.* From V 2.3.1 onwards, the reader is referred to the A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list) event to be used to merge patient information for a current episode.

=== 3.3.31 ADT/ACK - Update Person Information (Event A31)

An A31 event can be used to update person information on an MPI. It is similar to an A08 (update patient information) event, but an A08 (update patient information) event should be used to update patient information for a current episode. An A28 (add person information) or A31 can also be used for backloading MPI information for the person, or for backloading person and historical information.

To maintain backward compatibility with previous releases, the PV1 segment is required. However, a "pseudo-optional" PV1 can be achieved by valuing _PV1-2 - Patient Class_ to N - not applicable.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT – Participation Information Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin and end date of the provider, use the _PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _PRT-12 - End Date/Time_ in the PRT segment, with the applicable _PRT-4 – Role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

The A32 event is sent when an A10 (patient arriving-tracking) event is cancelled, either because of erroneous entry of the A10 event or because of a decision not to receive the patient after all.

If the patient was in a non-temporary location, then the _PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location_ may contain (if known) the original patient location prior to the erroneous A10 (patient arriving-tracking) event. If the patient was in a temporary location, then _PV1-11 - Temporary Location_ may contain (if known) the original patient location prior to the erroneous A10 (patient arriving-tracking) event.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

*Attention: The Merge Person – Patient ID (A39) event was maintained for backward compatibility only as of v2.3.1 and withdrawn as of v2.7.* From V 2.3.1 onwards, the reader is referred to the A41 (Merge Patient - Patient Account Number) event.

=== 3.3.40 ADT/ACK - Merge Patient - Patient Identifier List (Event A40)

A merge has been done at the patient identifier list level. That is, two _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ identifiers have been merged into one.

An A40 event is used to signal a merge of records for a patient that was incorrectly filed under two different identifiers. The "incorrect source identifier" identified in the MRG segment (_MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_) is to be merged with the required "correct target identifier" of the same "identifier type code" component identified in the PID segment (_PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_). The "incorrect source identifier" would then logically never be referenced in future transactions. It is noted that some systems may still physically keep this "incorrect identifier" for audit trail purposes or other reasons associated with database index implementation requirements.

The identifiers involved in identifying the patients may or may not have accounts, which may or may not have visits. An A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list) event is intended for merging patient records without merging other subordinate identifiers. Any other subordinate identifiers that were previously associated with the "incorrect source identifier" are now associated with the "correct target identifier." Specification of these other subordinate identifiers is not required.

This event and the message syntax do, however, allow for the specification of any other "new subordinate identifiers" (in addition to the _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ identifier). For those environments that may require changes to these other subordinate identifiers because of the A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list) event, it is required that the old and new identifiers be a "tightly coupled" pair.

See sections link:#merging-patientperson-information[_3.6.2_], "link:#merging-patientperson-information[_Merging patient/person information_]," and link:#merge[_3.6.2.1.2_], "link:#merge[_Merge_]," for a discussion of issues related to the implementation of merge messages.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other fields change, it is recommended that the A31 (update person information) event be used for person level updates and A08 (update patient information) event for patient level updates.

=== 3.3.41 ADT/ACK - Merge Account - Patient Account Number (Event A41)

A merge has been done at the account identifier level. That is, two _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ identifiers have been merged into one.

An A41 event is used to signal a merge of records for an account that was incorrectly filed under two different account numbers. The "incorrect source patient account number" identified in the MRG segment (_MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_) is to be merged with the "correct target patient account number" identified in the PID segment (_PID-18 - Patient Account Number_). The "incorrect source patient account number" would then logically never be referenced in future transactions. It is noted that some systems may still physically keep this "incorrect identifier" for audit trail purposes or other reasons associated with database index implementation requirements.

The patient account numbers involved may or may not have visits. An A41 (merge account-patient account number) is intended for merging account records without merging other subordinate identifiers. Any other subordinate identifiers that were previously associated with the "incorrect source account number" are now associated with the required "correct target account number." Specification of these other subordinate identifiers is not required.

This event and the message syntax do, however, allow for the specification of any other "new subordinate identifiers" (in addition to the _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ identifier). For those environments that may require changes to these other subordinate identifiers because of this A41 (merge account-patient account number) event, it is required that the old and new identifiers be a "tightly coupled" pair.

Each superior identifier associated with this account identifier level should have the same value in both the PID and MRG segments.

=== 3.3.42 ADT/ACK - Merge Visit - Visit Number (Event A42)

A merge has been done at the visit identifier level. That is, two _PV1-19 - Visit Number_ identifiers have been merged into one.

An A42 event is used to signal a merge of records for a visit that was incorrectly filed under two different visit numbers. The "incorrect source visit number" identified in the MRG segment (_MRG-5 - Prior Visit Number_) is to be merged with the required "correct target visit number" identified in the PV1 segment (_PV1-19 - Visit Number_). The "incorrect source visit number" would then logically never be referenced in future transactions. It is noted that some systems may still physically keep this "incorrect identifier" for audit trail purposes or other reasons associated with database index implementation requirements.

An A42 (merge visit-visit number) event is intended for merging visit records without merging other identifiers. Any other identifiers that were previously associated with the "incorrect source visit number" are now associated with the "correct target visit number."

Each superior identifier associated with this visit identifier level should have the same value in the PID and MRG segments, or the MRG and PV1 segments, as appropriate.

See sections link:#merging-patientperson-information[_3.6.2_&#44;] "link:#merging-patientperson-information[_Merging patient/person information_]," and link:#merge[_3.6.2.1.2_], "link:#merge[_Merge_]," for a discussion of issues related to the implementation of merge messages.

=== 3.3.43 ADT/ACK - Move Patient Information - Patient Identifier List (Event A43)

A move has been done at the patient identifier list level. Identifier to be moved in the _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ and _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_ will have the same value. The "from" (incorrect source patient ID) and "to" (correct target patient ID) identifiers have different values. See A43 examples in section 5. The identifiers involved in identifying the patient to be moved (_MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_) may or may not have accounts, which may or may not have visits. In any case, all subordinate data sets associated with the identifier in _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_ are moved along with the identifier, from the "incorrect source patient ID" to the "correct target patient ID."

No identifiers subordinate to the identifier (account number, visit number, alternate visit ID) are valued in this message. Specification of these other subordinate identifiers is not required.

This event and the message syntax do, however, allow for the specification of a "new identifier" (_PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_), which may be application and/or implementation specific and therefore require site negotiation.

See sections link:#merging-patientperson-information[_3.6.2_&#44;] "link:#merging-patientperson-information[_Merging patient/person information_]," and link:#move[_3.6.2.1.3_], "link:#move[_Move_]," for a discussion of issues related to the implementation of move messages.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When demographic data in other fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in conjunction with this message. However, all PID data associated with the "correct target identifier" (_PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_) are treated as updated information.

=== 3.3.44 ADT/ACK - Move Account Information - Patient Account Number (Event A44)

A move has been done at the account identifier level. That is, a _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ associated with one _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ has been moved to another patient identifier list.

An A44 event is used to signal a move of records identified by the _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_ from the "incorrect source patient identifier list" identified in the MRG segment (_MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_) to the "correct target patient identifier list" identified in the PID segment (_PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_).

The account number involved in identifying the account to be moved (_MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_) may or may not have visits. In any case, all subordinate data sets associated with the account number in _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_ are moved along with the account number, from the "incorrect source" ID (_MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_) to the "correct target" ID (_PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_).

No identifiers subordinate to the account number (visit number, alternate visit ID) are valued in this message.

This event and the message syntax do, however, allow for the specification of a "new identifier" (_PID-18 - Patient Account Number_), which may be application and/or implementation-specific and therefore require site negotiation.

All of the identifiers superior to the account number should be valued in both the MRG segment and the PID segment. In this message, the _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ is superior to the account number.

See sections link:#merging-patientperson-information[_3.6.2_&#44;] "link:#merging-patientperson-information[_Merging patient/person information_]," and link:#move[_3.6.2.1.3_], "link:#move[_Move_]," for a discussion of issues related to the implementation of move messages.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When demographic data in other fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in conjunction with this message. However, all PID data associated with the "account number" are treated as updated information.

=== 3.3.45 ADT/ACK - Move Visit Information - Visit Number (Event A45)

A move has been done at the visit identifier level. That is, a _PV1-19 - Visit Number_ or _PV1-50 - Alternate Visit ID_ associated with one account identifier (_PID-18 - Patient Account Number_) has been moved to another account identifier.

An A45 event is used to signal a move of records identified by the _MRG-5 - Prior Visit Number_ or the _MRG-6 - Prior Alternate Visit ID_ from the "incorrect source account identifier" identified in the MRG segment (_MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_) to the "correct target account identifier" identified in the PID segment (_PID-18 - Patient Account Number_).

This event and the message syntax do allow for the specification of "new identifiers" (_PV1-19 - Visit Number_, or _PV1-50 - Alternate Visit ID_), which may be application and/or implementation-specific and therefore require site negotiation.

All of the identifiers superior to the visit number or alternate visit ID should be valued in both the MRG segment and the PID segments. In this message, the account number and _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ are superior to the visit number and alternate visit ID.

See sections link:#merging-patientperson-information[_3.6.2_&#44;] "link:#merging-patientperson-information[_Merging patient/person information_]," and link:#move[_3.6.2.1.3_], "link:#move[_Move_]," for a discussion of issues related to the implementation of move messages. The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When demographic data in other fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in conjunction with this message. However, all PID data associated with the "correct target visit ID" are treated as updated information.

=== 3.3.46 ADT/ACK - Change Patient ID (Event A46)

*Attention: The Change Patient ID(A46) event was maintained for backward compatibility only as of v2.3.1 and withdrawn as of v2.7.* From V 2.3.1 onwards, the reader is referred to the A47 (Change patient Identifier List) event..

=== 3.3.47 ADT/ACK - Change Patient Identifier List (Event A47)

A change has been done at the patient identifier list level. That is, a single PID-3 - patient identifier list value has been found to be incorrect and has been changed.

An A47 event is used to signal a change of an incorrectly assigned _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ value. The "incorrect source identifier" value is stored in the MRG segment (_MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_) and is to be changed to the "correct target patient ID" value stored in the PID segment (_PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_).

The identifier involved in identifying the patient may or may not have accounts, which may or may not have visits. An A47 (change patient identifier list) event is intended for changing the value of the patient identifier list without affecting other subordinate identifiers. Any other subordinate identifiers that were previously associated with the "incorrect source identifier" are now associated with the "correct target identifier." Specification of these other subordinate identifiers is not required.

This event and the message syntax do, however, allow for the specification of "new subordinate identifiers" (in addition to the _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ identifier). For those environments that may require changes to these other subordinate identifiers because of this A47 (change patient identifier list) event, it is required that the old and new identifiers be a "tightly coupled" pair.

See sections link:#merging-patientperson-information[_3.6.2_&#44;] "link:#merging-patientperson-information[_Merging patient/person information_]," and link:#change-identifier[_3.6.2.1.4_], "link:#change-identifier[_Change identifier_]," for a discussion of issues related to the implementation of change messages.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When demographic data in other fields change, it is recommended that the A31 (update patient information) event be used in conjunction with this message.

=== 3.3.49 ADT/ACK - Change Patient Account Number (Event A49)

A change has been done at the account identifier level. That is, a PID-18 - patient account number has been found to be incorrect and has been changed.

An A49 event is used to signal a change of an incorrectly assigned account number value. The "incorrect source account number" value is stored in the MRG segment (_MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_) and is to be changed to the "correct target account number" value stored in the PID segment (_PID-18 - Patient Account Number_).

The patient account identifier involved in identifying the account may or may not have visits. An A49 (change patient account number) event is intended for changing the value of the account identifier without affecting other subordinate identifiers. Any other subordinate identifiers that were previously associated with the "incorrect source account number" are now associated with the "correct target account number". Specification of these other subordinate identifiers is not required.

This event and the message syntax do, however, allow for the specification of "new subordinate identifiers" (in addition to the _PID-18 - Patient Account Number Identifier_). For those environments that may require changes to these other subordinate identifiers because of this A49 (change patient account number) event, it is required that the old and new identifiers be a "tightly coupled" pair.

Each superior identifier associated with this account identifier level, i.e. the PID-3/MRG-1 should have the same value in both the PID and MRG segments.

=== 3.3.54 ADT/ACK - Change Attending Doctor (Event A54)

An A54 event is issued as a result of a change in the attending doctor responsible for the treatment of a patient.

When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

The new attending doctor of the patient should appear in the _PV1-7 - Attending Doctor_. For example, an A54 event can be used to notify the billing system that doctors' fees should be billed to the new doctor starting from the timestamp in the message.

The ROL - Role Segment was used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. As of v2.9, this has been deprecated in preference to the PRT segment as a more robust and flexible method of conveying participation. Hereafter, instructions for the PRT segment should apply, using the PRT segment. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments.

To communicate the begin and end date of the attending, referring, or admitting doctor, use the _PRT-11 - Begin Date/Time_ and the _PRT-12 - End Date/time_ in the PRT segment, with the applicable _PRT-4 – Role of Participation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment. Use "UP" in _PRT-2 - Action Code_.

The A55 event is sent when an A54 (change attending doctor) event is cancelled, either because of erroneous entry of the A54 event or because of a decision not to change the attending doctor after all. _PV1-7 - Attending Doctor_ must contain the patient's doctor prior to the change of attending doctor.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.

=== 3.3.59 QBP/RSP - Allocate Identifiers (QBP) and Response (RSP) (Events Q24 and K24)

This query/response is designed for interaction between a client system and an MPI (Master Person Index). The query consists of domains in which identifiers should be allocated. The response is new identifiers in those domains.

This event is not meant to cause the creation of a new person record, or to bind identifiers to a particular person record. The events _A28 - Add person information_ and _A24 - Link patient information_ should be used for that purpose. This event is meant to simply reserve the use of identifiers.

*Note:* The PID segment returned does not include any person demographics as the identifiers are not yet "attached" to any person record. Presumably the querying system would eventually send back to the MPI an _A28 Add person information_ to create a person record for the identifiers or an _A24 Link patient information_ to link the identifiers to an existing person record.

=== 3.3.60 ADT/ACK - Update Adverse Reaction Information (Event A60)

This trigger event is used when person/patient allergy information has changed. It is used in conjunction with a new allergy segment, the _IAM - Patient Allergy Information Segment-Unique Identifier_, which supports Action code/unique identifier mode update for repeating segments as defined in _2.10.4_, "_Protocol for interpreting repeating segments or segment groups in an update Message_."

=== 3.3.61 ADT/ACK - Change Consulting Doctor (Event A61)

An A61 event is used as a result of a change in the consulting physician(s) for the treatment of a patient.

When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition. If the Patient Administration system allows demographics to change at the same time (for example an address change), two messages (an A61 followed by an A08) should be sent.

The new consulting doctor(s) of the patient should appear in the _PV1-9 - Consulting Doctor_ and may appear in a role segment per new consulting physician.

If a consulting doctor stops being consulting doctor for this patient-visit, the end date/time can be sent in the _PRT-12 - End Date/Time_.

For example, an A61 event can be used to notify the billing system that doctors' fees for being a consulting doctor, should be billed to the new doctor(s) starting from the timestamp in the message.

It is recommended that field _EVN-6 - Event Occurred_ contains the date/time the event actually occurred to the patient.

The ROL segment has been deprecated and retained for backwards compatiblity purposes only as of v 2.9. The reader is referred to the PRT segment instead.

The PRT – Participation Information Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the PRT segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Providers corresponding to the PV1 data are reported in the PRT segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the PRT segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the PRT segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the _PRT-11 - Participation Begin Date/Time_ and the _PRT-12 - Participation End Date/Time_ in the PRT segment, with the applicable _PRT-4 - PArticipation_. Refer to Chapter 7 for the definition of the PRT segment.

=== 3.3.62 ADT/ACK - Cancel Change Consulting Doctor (Event A62)

The A62 event is sent when an A61 (change consulting doctor) event is cancelled, either because of erroneous entry of the A61 event or because of a decision not to change the consulting physician(s) after all. _PV1-9 - Consulting Doctor_ must show the patient's doctor prior to the change being cancelled.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event is used.

=== 3.3.63 QBP/RSP - Find Candidates including Visit Information (QBP) and Response (RSP) (Events Q32 and K32) 

This query/response is designed for interaction between a client system and an MPI (Master Person Index). The query consists of a set of demographic and/or visit attribute values for a person, and the response is the list of candidates considered by the MPI to match that set.

Each returned person, specified by a PID segment and by a PV1 segment containing information about the current visit, can also have an optional QRI - Query Response Instance segment containing information about the quality of the match.

==== *3.4.1.6* EVN-6 Event Occurred (DTM) 01278

Definition: This field contains the date/time that the event actually occurred. For example, on a transfer (A02 transfer a patient), this field would contain the date/time the patient was actually transferred. On a cancellation event, this field should contain the date/time that the event being cancelled occurred.

==== *3.4.1.7* EVN-7 Event Facility (HD) 01534

Components: <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field identifies the actual facility where the event occurred as differentiated from the sending facility (MSH-4). It would be the facility at which the Operator (EVN-5) has entered the event.

Use Case: System A is where the patient is originally registered. This registration message is sent to an MPI, System B. The MPI needs to broadcast the event of this update and would become the sending facility. This new field would allow for retention of knowledge of the originating facility where the event occurred. The MPI could be the assigning authority for the ID number as well which means that it is performing the function of assigning authority for the facility originating the event.

=== 3.4.2 PID - Patient Identification Segment

The PID segment is used by all applications as the primary means of communicating patient identification information. This segment contains permanent patient identifying and demographic information that, for the most part, is not likely to change frequently.

It should be noted that from V2.4 onwards the demographics of animals can also be sent in the PID segment (see PID-35 to PID-38).

The assigning authority, the fourth component of the patient identifiers, is a HD data type that is uniquely associated with the assigning authority that originally assigned the number. A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of assigning authorities that may be potential assignors of patient identification (and other important identification) numbers. The list will be one of the institution's master dictionary lists. Since third parties (other than the assignors of patient identification numbers) may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient identification numbers, the assigning authority in the patient identification numbers may not be the same as the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH. The assigning authority must be unique across applications at a given site. This field is required in HL7 implementations that have more than a single Patient Administration application assigning such numbers. The assigning authority and identifier type codes are strongly recommended for all CX data types.

With HL7 V2.3, the nomenclature for the fourth component of the patient identifiers was changed from "assigning facility ID" to "assigning authority". While the identifier may be unique to a given healthcare facility (for example, a medical record assigned by facility A in Hospital XYZ), the identifier might also be assigned at a system level (for example a corporate person index or enterprise number spanning multiple facilities) or by a government entity, for example a nationally assigned unique individual identifier. While a facility is usually an assigning authority, not all assigning authorities are facilities. Therefore, the fourth component is referred to as an assigning authority, but retains backward compatibility using the construct of the HD data type (see the note in chapter 2). Additionally, CX data types support the use of assigning facility (HD) as the sixth component.

In order to support “name to use” to indicate how to address the patient, when that does not match their legal name, include an occurrence of Patient Name (PID-5), where the nametype code (PID-5.7) is valued ‘N’.

Definition: This field contains the last update date and time for the patient's/person's identifying and demographic data, as defined in the PID segment. Receiving systems will use this field to determine how to apply the transaction to their systems. If the receiving system (such as an enterprise master patient index) already has a record for the person with a later last update date/time, then the EMPI could decide not to apply the patient's/person's demographic and identifying data from this transaction.

==== *3.4.2.34* PID-34 Last Update Facility (HD) 01538

Components: <Namespace ID (IS)> ^ <Universal ID (ST)> ^ <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field identifies the facility of the last update to a patient's/person's identifying and demographic data, as defined in the PID segment. Receiving systems or users will use this field to determine how to apply the transaction to their systems. If the receiving system (such as a hospital's patient management system) already has a record for the patient/person, then it may decide to only update its data if the source is a "trusted" source. A hospital might consider other hospitals trusted sources, but not "trust" updates from non-acute care facilities. For example:

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

Definition: A code representing the taxonomic classification (e.g. species and/or breed) of an organism. This may include the common or scientific name in the description component, based on the coding system(s) used. SNOMED-CT is the recommended coding system. If this field is not valued, a human is assumed. If the specificity of the coding system is insufficient to represent the organism to the degree desired, the most detailed coded value available may be used in this field and additional information sent in the text field, _PID-37 – Strain_.

For example:

...|L-80700^Canine, NOS^SNM3|...

...|L-80100^Bovine^SNM3|...

...|L-80A00^Feline^SNM3|...

Definition: *From v 2.8 onward, this field has been retained for backward compatibility only.* The specific breed of animal. This field, unlike Species and Strain is specific to animals and cannot be generally used for all living organisms. SNOMED is the recommended coding system. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70447[_User-defined Table 0447 - Breed Code_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

Conditionality Rule: This field must be valued if _PID-37 - Strain_ is valued.

For example, (showing primary and alternative coding systems, using locally defined "American Kennel Club" nomenclature):

...|L-80733^ Staffordshire bull terrier^SNM3^^American Staffordshire Terrier^99AKC|...

...|L-80900^Weimaraner^SNM3|...

...|L-80439^Peruvian Paso Horse^SNM3|...

==== *3.4.2.37* PID-37 Strain (ST) 01541

Definition: This field contains the specific strain of animal. It can also be expanded to include strain of any living organism and is not restricted to animals.

Example:

...|DeKalb|...

...|Balb/c|...

...|DXL|...

==== *3.4.2.38* PID-38 Production Class Code (CWE) 01542

Definition: This field contains the code and/or text indicating the primary use for which the living subject was bred or grown. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70429[_User-defined Table 0429 - Production Class Code_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. For example:

...|DA^Dairy^L|...

...|MT^Meat^L|...

...|RA^Racing^L|...

==== *3.4.2.39* PID-39 Tribal Citizenship (CWE) 01840

Components: <Identifier (ST)> ^ <Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Coding System (ID)> ^ <Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Original Text (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Identifier (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Text (ST)> ^ <Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)>

This field contains the information related to a person's tribal citizenship. For tribal citizenship, in the United States, HL7 recommends using the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Tribal Identity List. For a local definition, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70171[_User-defined Table 0171 - Citizenship_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables should be used.

This field repeats since persons can have tribal membership(s) and can be members of more than one tribe. The Name of Coding System component(s) of the CWE datatype should be used to identify the table from which tribal membership is drawn.

==== *3.4.2.40* PID-40 Patient Telecommunication Information (XTN) 02289

Components: <WITHDRAWN Constituent> ^ <Telecommunication Use Code (ID)> ^ <Telecommunication Equipment Type (ID)> ^ <Communication Address (ST)> ^ <Country Code (SNM)> ^ <Area/City Code (SNM)> ^ <Local Number (SNM)> ^ <Extension (SNM)> ^ <Any Text (ST)> ^ <Extension Prefix (ST)> ^ <Speed Dial Code (ST)> ^ <Unformatted Telephone number (ST)> ^ <Effective Start Date (DTM)> ^ <Expiration Date (DTM)> ^ <Expiration Reason (CWE)> ^ <Protection Code (CWE)> ^ <Shared Telecommunication Identifier (EI)> ^ <Preference Order (NM)>

Subcomponents for Shared Telecommunication Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains the patient's personal telecommunication contact information. This field replaces _PID-13 – Phone Number - Home_ and _PID-14 – Phone Number – Business_ with the intention that the components of the XTN data type be used to identify phone usage (Telecommunication use code) and type of equipment (telecommunication equipment type). Jointly, these components will describe the nature of the telecommunication data contained in this field and removes the sequenced-based assumptions in PID-13 and PID-14.

=== 3.4.3 PV1 ‑ Patient Visit Segment

The PV1 segment is used by Registration/Patient Administration applications to communicate information on an account or visit-specific basis. The default is to send account level data. To use this segment for visit level data _PV1-51 - Visit Indicator_ must be valued to "V". The value of PV-51 affects the level of data being sent on the PV1, PV2, and any other segments that are part of the associated PV1 hierarchy (e.g., ROL, DG1, or OBX).

The facility ID, the optional fourth component of each patient location field, is a HD data type that is uniquely associated with the healthcare facility containing the location. A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of facilities that may be potential assignors of patient locations. The list will be one of the institution's master dictionary lists. Since third parties other than the assignors of patient locations may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient locations, the facility ID in the patient location may not be the same as that implied by the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH. The facility ID must be unique across facilities at a given site. This field is required for HL7 implementations that have more than a single healthcare facility with bed locations, since the same <point of care> ^ <room> ^ <bed> combination may exist at more than one facility.

Definition: This field is used by systems to categorize patients by site. It does not have a consistent industry-wide definition. It is subject to site‑specific variations. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70004[_User-defined Table 0004 - Patient Class_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

"Commercial Account" is used by reference labs for specimen processing when the service is billed back to a third party. A registration is processed for the specimen to facilitate the subsequent billing. The identity of the patient may be known or unknown. In either case, for billing and statistical purposes, the patient class is considered a commercial account due to the third party billing responsibility.

"Not Applicable" is used only in cases where the PV1 segment itself is not applicable but is retained in the message definitions for backwards compatibility (for example when a managed care system sends A28, A29, or A31 messages to indicate the enrolment of a patient in the system and there is no scheduled "visit" or "encounter" and hence the entire PV1 segment is not applicable).

Definition: This field contains the patient's initial assigned location or the location to which the patient is being moved. The first component may be the nursing station for inpatient locations, or clinic or department, for locations other than inpatient. For canceling a transaction or discharging a patient, the current location (after the cancellation event or before the discharge event) should be in this field.

Definition: This field uniquely identifies the patient's pre‑admit account. Some systems will continue to use the pre‑admit number as the billing number after the patient has been admitted. For backward compatibility, a ST data type can be sent; however, HL7 recommends use of the CX data type, like the account number, for new implementations. The assigning authority and identifier type codes are strongly recommended for all CX data types.

This field is typically needed when the NK1 is an organization. The _XPN.7 Name Type Code_, and not the order, conveys how the name should be interpreted. As of v2.7, Name Type Code is required. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70200[_HL7 Table 0200 - Name Type_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values. Specification of meaning based on sequence is deprecated.

In addition to allowing repetition of this field for transmitting multiple names with different Name Type Codes, repetition also allows for representing the same name in different character sets based on the value in _XPN.8 Name Representation Code_.

Definition: This field contains the code, mnemonic, or description used to uniquely identify an allergen group when both a detailed allergy (_IAM-3 - Allergen Code/Mnemonic/Description_) and group level (_IAM-10 - Allergen Group Code/Mnemonic/Description_) need to be communicated. In cases where systems want to communicate both a specific drug allergy and the group of drugs to which the specific drug belongs (i.e., Bactrim and Sulfa drugs; Ceclor and Penicillins/Cephalosporins) then the specific drug allergy is sent in _IAM-3 - Allergen Code/Mnemonic/Description_ and the group level is sent in _IAM-10 - Allergen Group Code/Mnemonic/Description_. However, if only a group level is being communicated, then it can be sent in IAM-3 as the primary identifier of the allergy.

=== 3.4.10 MRG ‑ Merge Patient Information Segment

The MRG segment provides receiving applications with information necessary to initiate the merging of patient data as well as groups of records. It is intended that this segment be used throughout the Standard to allow the merging of registration, accounting, and clinical records within specific applications.

The assigning authority, the fourth component of the patient identifiers, is an HD data type that is uniquely associated with the assigning authority that originally assigned the number. A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of assigning authorities that may be potential assignors of patient identification (and other important identification) numbers. The list will be one of the institution's master dictionary lists. Since third parties (other than the assignors of patient identification numbers) may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient identification numbers, the assigning authority in the patient identification numbers may not be the same as those of the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH. The assigning authority must be unique across applications at a given site. This field is required in HL7 implementations that have more than a single Patient Administration application assigning such numbers.

=== 3.4.14 ARV - Access Restrictions segment

The ARV segment is used to communicate the requested/required type of access restrictions from system to system, at both the person/patient and the encounter/visit level__.__

The Access Restrictions segment (ARV) sent after the MSH acts as a manifest and declares the privacy and security classification (i.e the confidentiality level), the sensitivity (i.e. access restriction reason) and provides handling instructions (e.g. what the data can be used for, what must be done to protect it and what may not be done with the data). The segment is optional and can repeat.

Examples:

A person/patient may have the right to object to any or all of his/her information to be disclosed. In addition, the patient may request that protected information not be disclosed to family members or friends who may be involved in their care or for notification purposes.

A realm or organization may have certain privacy policies.

A patient may have the right to opt out of being included on facility directories.

In an international context, a physician may be culturally obligated to protect the patient's privacy.

Any "opt-in" or "opt-out" restrictions are communicated in _ARV-3 - Access Restriction Value._ This segment replaces PD1-12 and PV2-22, which have been deprecated in V2.6. The ARV segment is optional and as of 2.9 is sent immediately following the MSH segment to allow declaration of access restrictions for specific data elements (_ARV-9 – Access Restriction Message Location_), that are different from the overall security level declared in the Message Header Segment. The ARV segment can repeat, so that different security attributes across message elements can be declared.

*Usage Notes:*

The individual system security may want to utilize the Access Restriction Value along with the Access Restriction Reason and with the Confidentiality Code from Code defined in the Security Classification Tag (ARV-7)in order to implement the appropriate type of protection for the identified data. Each system has the flexibility to incorporate/map the access values into their security system appropriately; the actual implementation for access to protected data is determined by the individual system. The Access Restriction Values supported by an enterprise/system would be defined and determined by that organization.

It is expected that these access restriction values would be utilized in [.underline]#combination with# other system security information (e.g., patient locations, user department, caregiver-patient relationships, other access restriction parameters) to determine user access.

System implementers should carefully control access to the restriction codes and values, as they themselves hold sensitive information.

Definition: This field carries the unique identifier for this access restriction and is conditionally required when ARV-2 is NOT valued ‘S’ to support the use of action code for tracking changes when using dynamic mode. This instance identifier is persistent between messages. Implementation guides may restrict what mode to use, which will affect the effective optionality of this field.

=== 3.4.15 OH1 - Person Employment Status segment

The OH1 segment is a clinical statement about the subject’s state of being employed at the point in time the statement is recorded. Awareness of the subject’s Employment Status can assist in understanding the subject’s resources, access to benefits, and demands at home and work. If the subject is working (regardless of pay), information about their current job is communicated in OH2 Past or Present Job Segment. Information about volunteer work and past jobs can be collected in the Past or Present Job Segment regardless of current employment status, i.e., even if the subject is not employed at the time.

The intent is for the segment to be allowed to repeat within a message definition to allow a history of employment status for the patient.

This segment relates only to the patient and is not intended to relate to the Next of Kin.

Examples:

A person/patient may be currently employed following a period of choosing to not be in the labor force. This would be represented by a repeating OH1 segment.

=== 3.4.16 OH2 - Past or Present Job segment

The OH2 segment is used to communicate the information about a job or jobs which the subject currently holds or has held in the past. It includes related observations about the occupation (type of work), the type of business (industry) in which that occupation is performed, supervisory level (including military pay grade), and the employer's name and location. It should also include observations about the job's compensation and sector employment type (e.g., paid work, self-employed, volunteer) and work schedule, and may also contain observations for job duties and occupational exposures. The type of work a person performs (occupation) and their industry (type of business in which they work) are critical data elements for patient care, population health, and public health, with the current information being the most important. In the health care encounter, current occupation and industry are important because they provide information regarding the exposures a person may have to substances/environments/hazards that may cause illness/injury or may impact the treatment plan. The combination of occupation and industry serves as a key indicator of the person’s work environment. The segment is designed to ensure that these data remain associated with one-another in perpetuity, even if multiple jobs are included.

This segment may relate either to the patient or to the Next of Kin.

The intent is for the segment to be allowed to repeat within a message definition to enable a job history for the person__.__

Examples:

A person/patient may currently hold a job as carpenter, and previously held a job as a painter. This would be represented by repeating OH2 segments.

=== 3.4.17 OH3 - Usual Work segment

The OH3 segment contains information about the occupation which the subject has held for the longest duration through his or her working history, at the point in time the statement is recorded. Longest-held occupations can be associated with conditions that develop slowly over time or even after the person is no longer performing that type of work, e.g., some respiratory conditions and cancers. It optionally includes a total duration observation, because a person can be in and out of a given occupation over time. In addition, knowing when the person began working in this occupation can provide information about potential exposures and allows the clinician to assess whether sufficient time has elapsed for a chronic condition to appear, i.e. the latency period. This guides appropriate use of screening tests to detect early disease. This segment may be related to either patient or to the Next of Kin.

Examples:

A person/patient may have worked as a waiter for 3 years, and worked as a nurse for 20 years. The Usual Work would reflect an occupation of nurse as the longest held occupation.

The intent is for the segment to be allowed to repeat within a message definition to enable communication of Usual Work for multiple family members, but not the patient. For instance, the Usual Work segment may be repeated in multiple Next of Kin groups in order to allow for inclusion of mother, father, or other related persons, but not more than one usual job is permitted for one person.

Examples:

A person/ may have worked in a combat zone for 2 years, followed by 3 years where there was no combat zone work, returning to combat zone work for another 2 years. This would be reflected as two Combat work segments documenting the date ranges for the 2 periods when the combat zone work occurred.

=== 3.4.19 GSP – Person Gender and Sex Segment

It is imperative that both sex and gender vocabulary be formally integrated into clinical care because they are not interchangeable. Both influence health outcomes. Gender-marginalized individuals face significant barriers to adequate and culturally responsive healthcare, leading to numerous health disparities. The single field PID-8 Sex with user-defined values was renamed in V2.4 (2000) to Administrative Sex in recognition that it was insufficient or inappropriate for conveying Sex Parameter for Clinical Use. There are now several fields in HL7 v2 that support communicating administrative sex values for various actors; PID-8 for the patient’s Administrative Sex, IN1-43 for the Insured’s Administrative Sex, GT1-9 for the Guarantor’s Administrative Sex, NK1-15 for the Next of Kin / Associated Party’s Administrative Sex, etc. It is widely recognized that the concept of Administrative Sex is not clearly defined and is very widely overloaded with other concepts in real-world implementations. The following segments Person Gender and Sex (GSP), Recorded Gender and Sex (GSR) and Sex Parameter for Clinical Use (GSC) address this gap by placing them inside the message structure in a way that provides the context, e.g. following the Patient segments (PID, PD1, PD2), the Next-of-Kin segment (NK1) or the Guarantor (GT1) segment, etc.

The GSP segment conveys person-level concepts relating to an individual. Common concepts known to be important include:

____
• Gender Identity which is an individual's personal sense of being a man, woman, boy, girl, nonbinary, or something else. This datum represents an individual’s identity, ascertained by asking them what that identity is.

• Personal Pronouns which indicate the pronoun(s) specified by the individual to use when referring to the person in speech, in clinical notes, in written instructions and in other communications. Avoiding incorrect pronoun use and person misgendering is crucial in transgender and gender-diverse care. It is important to reliably exchange personal pronouns that the individual has specifically reported they want used. Different pronouns may be used in one care setting than another care setting. The pronouns used in the work environment may be different than those in the care setting.

• Sexual Orientation specifies a person’s identification of their emotional, romantic, sexual, or affectional attraction to another person.

The HL7 base specification does not prescribe if/how a system maintains an audit trail of changes to the data represented in the GSP segment. Depending on system design and workflow needs, it may be necessary to retain the gender and sex history for an individual.

The use of the GSP segment is not restricted to use with a patient alone. Other individuals represented in a message (e.g. a next of kin or staff) may also have personal gender and sex values.

=== 3.4.20 GSR – Recorded Gender and Sex Segment

____
The recorded sex and gender is to be used to differentiate existing sex or gender data. This element is used for existing 'sex' or 'gender' elements in a document or record when the intent and meaning is unclear. An individual may have zero to many such attributes. For example, the individual’s birth certificate information, passport information, driver’s license information and national identity document information may all be present. Sex assigned at birth (SAAB), while very common and considered essential in some jurisdictions, is considered a recorded sex and gender entry.

Documenting the recorded gender or sex is an important aspect of transgender and gender-diverse care as an individual’s identity documents may be updated at different rates or for different reasons. For instance, a trans woman may be able to update her driver’s license to ‘F’ but her state might not allow changing a value on her birth certificate, which may still read ‘M’.

The HL7 base specification does not proscribe if/how a system maintains an audit trail of changes to the data represented in the GSR segment. Depending on system design and workflow needs, it may be necessary to retain the recorded gender and sex history for an individual.

The use of the GSR segment is not restricted to use with a patient alone. Other individuals represented in a message (e.g. a next of kin) may also have recorded gender and sex values.

=== 3.4.21 GSC – Sex Parameter for Clinical Use Segment

A Sex Parameter for Clinical Use is a parameter that provides guidance on how a recipient should apply settings or reference ranges that are derived from observable information such as an organ inventory, recent hormone lab tests, genetic testing, menstrual status, obstetric history, etc.  This property is intended for use in clinical decision making, and indicates that treatment or diagnostic tests should consider best practices associated with the relevant reference population.  When exchanging these concepts, refer to the guidance in the [Gender Harmony Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/xprod/ig/uv/gender-harmony/).While clinical decision-making processes could account for the specific physiological or anatomical attributes of the patient, there are several practical considerations, such as patient privacy and limited capabilities of existing systems which create the need for a categorization that is easy to exchange. The Sex Parameter for Clinical Use categorization is intended to bridge the gap between the hypothetical ideal and the practical needs of operational systems.

Sex Parameter for Clinical Use is a contextual concept. For example, a patient may generally be categorized as male-typical, but for a specific lab test, the resulting lab should use the reference ranges associated with a female-typical reference population. In this case, systems may provide a patient-context Sex Parameter for Clinical Usethat acts as a 'default' for most care and annotate the lab order with a context-specific Sex Parameter for Clinical Use. Systems may determine what enclosing contexts are useful, but Patient, Encounter, Order and Episode Of Care are enclosing contexts that may often apply.

Prior to the definition of Sex Parameter for Clinical Use as a concept, systems may have used administrative gender as an approximation of patient-level Sex Parameter for Clinical Use. This practice required pre-coordination among exchange partners to explicitly overload the administrative sex concept for use as a clinical sex concept. In cases where there was no pre-coordination, some systems may have incorrectly inferred information about a patient's clinical sex from administrative gender.

For ease of interoperability, a patient’s Sex Parameter for Clinical Use is constrained to four possible categories. Any patient for which special considerations apply should be categorized as 'Specified'. The 'Specified' category is often represented as 'Other' in existing systems.

*female-typical* - Available data indicates that diagnostics, analytics, and treatments should consider best practices associated with female reference populations.

*male-typical* - Available data indicates that diagnostics, analytics, and treatments should consider best practices associated with male reference populations.

*specified* - Available data indicates that diagnostics, analytics, and treatment best practices may be undefined or not aligned with existing sex-derived reference populations. Individuals or systems providing care should either use default behavior that is safe for both male-typical and female-typical populations, individually review treatment options with the patient, or carefully inspect relevant observations before proceeding with treatment.

*unknown* - The Sex Parameter for Clinical Use cannot be determined because there are no relevant evidence or documentation, or the evidence or documentation are not sufficient to determine a value.

 Sex Parameter for Clinical Use History and Practices

Because the Sex Parameter for Clinical Use can be context-specific, on rare occasions there may be more than one concurrent Sex Parameter for Clinical Use for a patient. For example, there could be multiple procedure results, each identifying a context specific Sex Parameter for Clinical Use determination used to set the normal range used.

The Sex Parameter for Clinical Use values exchanged in a message should be limited to those appropriate for the context(s) in the message. That is, an individual may have different Sex Parameter for Clinical Use values for two different procedures, but if the message only contains one of the procedures, only the Sex Parameter for Clinical Use value related to that procedure should be included in the message. Note that a single Sex Parameter for Clinical Use value may apply to multiple contexts within a single message (i.e. GSC-6 is allowed to repeat and point to multiple locations within the message).

The GSC segment should only be used to declare Sex Parameter for Clinical Use values for the patient conveyed in the message. Conveyance of a Sex Parameter for Clinical Use for other individuals that may be described in the message (e.g. next of kin, guarantors, providers) is not permitted as these individuals will not have clinical contexts within the message.

Patient Adam A. Everyman was pre-admitted on January 6^th^, 2007 for ambulatory surgery, which is scheduled for January 10, 2007 at 1400. As part of the pre-admission process, he specified two emergency contacts as well as employer, insurance, and guarantor information. He also was measured and weighed.

*Note:* Above, the REGADT system supports the entry of four NK1 type records: first, second, and third emergency contacts and employer information. A third emergency contact was not provided for Adam A. Everyman. However, an NK1 record must be sent to support "snapshot" mode of update. The REGADT system also supports entry of two insurance plans, one guarantor, and one diagnosis.

== 3.6 Implementation Notes

=== 3.6.1 Swapping a patient

Some systems may handle this as a single function. Others may require a multiple process in which:

{empty}a) patient A is assigned a temporary location

{empty}b) patient B is assigned patient A's location

{empty}c) patient A is assigned patient B's prior location

This three‑step scenario requires three separate transfer messages instead of a single swap message. If all beds in a hospital are occupied, it may be necessary to use a dummy location.

=== 3.6.2 Merging patient/person information

==== *3.6.2.0* 

==== *3.6.2.1* Definitions: Merge, move, and change identifier events

The term "identifier" is used throughout this section. An identifier is associated with a set (or sets) of data. For example, an identifier (_PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_) may be a medical record number which has associated with it account numbers (_PID-18 - Patient Account Number_). Account number (_PID-18 - Patient Account Number_) is a type of identifier which may have associated with it visit numbers (_PV1-19 - Visit Number_).

This section addresses the events that occur usually for the purposes of correcting errors in person, patient, account, or visit identifiers. The types of errors that occur typically fall into three categories:

{empty}1) *Duplicate identifier created* +
The registrar fails to identify an existing person, patient, account, or visit and creates a new, "duplicate" record instead of using the existing record. A "merge" operation is used to fix this type of error.

{empty}2) *Incorrect identifier selected* +
The registrar mistakenly selects the wrong person, patient, or account and creates or attaches a patient, account, or visit underneath the incorrect person, patient, or account. A "move" operation is used to fix this type of error.

{empty}3) *Incorrect identifier assigned* +
The registrar accidentally types in the wrong new identifier for a person, patient, account, or visit. This type of mistake usually occurs when identifiers are manually assigned (not system generated). A "change identifier" operation is used to fix this type of error.

===== 3.6.2.1.1 Hierarchy of Identifiers

This section was written from the perspective of one controlling MPI and does not adequately cover the implementation of peer MPIs or multiple enterprise identifiers. To avoid future problems implementors should carefully examine the inferences of multiple identifiers.

Enterprise level MPI systems may collaborate forming either peer-to-peer or hierarchical relationships. When this occurs, multiple enterprise level identifiers may be required in the context of a single HL7 message. An example of a peer-to-peer MPI relationship might be represented by a data sharing application between the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Department of Defense, where each have their own MPI. An example of a hierarchical MPI relationship might be required by the need for local, city, and state organizations to collaborate, where each have an MPI.

These events assume a hierarchy of identifiers exists between person, patient, account, and visit. The hierarchy is as follows:

Level 3 - Patient (identified by _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_)

Level 2 - Account (identified by _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_)

Level 1 - Visit (identified by _PV1-19 - Visit Number_)

The visit-level identifier _PV1-19 - Visit Number_ is the lowest level identifier and is considered subordinate to the account-level identifier _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_.

This means that visit identifiers are defined within the context of an account identifier, and implies that visit identifiers are unique within account identifiers. Similarly, account identifiers are subordinate to, and unique within, patient identifiers; patient identifiers are subordinate to, and unique within, person identifiers.

Conversely, the person-level identifier is the highest-level identifier and is considered superior to the patient-level identifiers, which are superior to the account-level identifier, which is superior to any visit-level identifiers.

Note that these events will also apply to environments in which one or more of these levels do not occur. For example, some environments may not have a person (or MPI) level, or they may not have a visit level, or they may have a visit level without an account level. The hierarchy concept is depicted graphically below. For example, Adam Everyman might be assigned an MPI number at the Good Health Hospital network (depicted by the circle). He may have different medical records at two hospitals within the network (depicted by the squares). Associated with each of these medical records are two accounts (depicted by the triangles). Note that the environment illustrated does not support the "visit" level, although in other implementations it might.

____

===== 3.6.2.1.2 Merge

A merge event signals that two distinct records have been combined together into a single record with a single set of identifiers and data surviving at the level of the merge. All records at a level subordinate to the merged identifier are combined under the surviving record. For example, an A40 (merge patient - patient identifier list) event would be sent to signal that two person records (identified by _MRG-1 - Prior Patient ID_ and by _PID-3 - Patient ID_) have been merged into a single record. All of the identifiers, accounts, and visits under the person record are not merged together - they are instead combined under the same person record. The following figure graphically depicts the merge event:

____
image:extracted-media/media/image2.wmf[extracted-media/media/image2]
____

*Note:* It is not the intent of the merge definition to define the application or implementation specifics of how various systems or environments define, use or handle non-surviving information. "Non-surviving" in this document implies that a data set was existing in a fashion that was incorrect. Merging it into a new data set in itself implies that where there were two datasets, there is now only one. The means by which any system or environment conveys this new data set and the absence of the previous data set to the user is application specific. It is noted that some systems may still physically keep these "incorrect" datasets for audit trail or other purposes.

===== 3.6.2.1.3 Move

A "move" involves transferring one or more datasets (identified by a subordinate identifier) from one superior identifier at the next hierarchical level to another superior identifier at the next hierarchical level, while all identifiers involved retain their original value. An exception to retaining the original identifier value may occur if any of the subordinate source identifiers already exist under the target superior identifier. In this case the identifier value may have to be renumbered in order to be uniquely identified under the target superior identifier. (Refer to section _3.6.2.2.8_, "link:#_A45_-_move_visit information - visi[_A45 - Move visit information_]" for an illustration of this.)

A move event signals that a patient, account, or visit has been moved from one person, patient, or account, respectively, to another. All records at a subordinate level are also moved. For example, an A43 (move patient information - patient identifier list) event would be sent to signal that a medical records administrator has moved a medical record attached to an incorrect person to a correct person. The following figure graphically depicts the move event:

____
image:extracted-media/media/image3.wmf[extracted-media/media/image3,width=576,height=174]
____

*Note*: The move event implies that all data related to the incorrect source ID and its subordinate IDs (specified in the MRG segment) will be moved to the correct target ID (specified in the PID or PV1 segment). Specifying each subordinate ID in repeating PID/MRG/PV1 sets is optional but not recommended.

===== 3.6.2.1.4 Change identifier

A change identifier event signals that a single person, patient, account, or visit identifier has been changed. It does not reflect a merge or a move; it is simply a change of an identifier. For example, a "Change Identifier" event would be sent to signal that the registrar has changed an incorrectly assigned person identifier to a correct person identifier. The following picture graphically depicts this event:

____
image:extracted-media/media/image4.wmf[extracted-media/media/image4]
____

===== 3.6.2.1.5 Source and target identifiers

Merge, move, and change events reference target and source identifiers. The incorrect source identifier is specified in the MRG segment. The correct target identifier is identified in the PID or PV1 segment. For example, when you are changing a patient account number the source would be _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_. The target is _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_.

===== 3.6.2.1.6 Tightly coupled relationship

When patient/person identifiers are the target in merge, move, or change events, as specified in the _PID-2 - Patient ID_, _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ and _PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID-PID_, the associated source identifiers in the _MRG-4 - Prior Patient ID_, _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_, and _MRG-2 - Prior Alternate Patient ID_, respectively, must be "tightly coupled." Each event that is defined as a merge, move, or change message carries the "tightly" coupled relationship at the appropriate level in one of two ways: first, by virtue of positional placement in the sequence of identifiers; or, second, by identifier type and assigning authority. The methodology used to establish the definition of "tightly coupled" relationship is determined by site negotiation. The recommended definition is by virtue of positional placement in the sequence of identifiers (pairwise). In addition, HL7 allows the use of the second definition by identifier type and assigning authority as an acceptable convention to establish a "tightly coupled" relationship. In the absence of a site negotiated definition, it is assumed that the positional placement of the identifiers is the default method.

The list of identifiers can be aligned positionally in their respective segment fields and processed by the receiving system by virtue of their order. This is sometimes referred to as an "ordered pairwise" relationship and is described further in section _3.6.2.1.7_, "link:#ordered-pairwise-relationship[_Ordered pairwise relationship_]".

Alternatively, the uniqueness of the identifiers included in the message is determined by the combination of identifier type and assigning authority. It is assumed that both sending system and receiving system can inspect both of these qualifiers as a message is constructed or processed to determine the "tightly coupled" relationship between the identifiers. This can be referred to as "identifier type/assigning authority" relationship and is described further in section _3.6.2.1.8_, "link:#_Identifier_type_/_assigning authori[_Identifier type/assigning authority relationship_]".

The pairing of identifiers between the MRG segment fields and their associated identifiers in the PID or PV1 segment are defined below:

[width="100%",cols="31%,9%,60%",]
|===
|*Person* | |
|_PID-2 - Patient ID_ |*_with_* |_MRG-4 - Prior Patient ID_
|*Patient* | |
|_Pid-3 - Patient Identifier List_ |*_with_* |_MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_
| |*_and by_* |Explicit order of identifiers in the list
| |*_or by_* |_<identifier type code>_ and _<assigning authority>_ field components

|_PV1-19 - Visit Number_ |*_with_* |_MRG-5 - Prior Visit Number_
|_PV1-50 - Alternate Visit ID_ |*_with_* |_MRG-6 - Prior Alternate Visit ID_
|===

===== 3.6.2.1.7 Ordered pairwise relationship

In a strict sense, this type of relationship is characterized by a one-to-one association based on type (e.g., medical record number to medical record number, etc.) and the corresponding order of the element, and is typically found in list or set operations. However, for purposes of practical implementation, this relationship will be defined as a simple one-for-one pairing, as exists between the _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ and the _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_. In other words, elements "A", "B", and "C" in the first list would directly correspond to elements "X", "Y", and "Z" in the second list. No consideration is made to the type or value of the corresponding elements; it is the explicit order of the elements which controls the association process. This scenario could be expressed as follows:

List~1~ = \{A,B,C}

List~2~ = \{X,Y,Z}

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|*A : X*
|*B : Y*
|*C : Z*
|===

A second scenario may arise which deserves mention. As in the list example above, elements "A", "B", and "C" in the first list would "pair-up" with elements "X", "Y", "Z", "Q", "R", and "S" in the second list. Again, no consideration is made to the type or value of the corresponding elements; it is the order and presence which controls the association process. This scenario could be expressed as follows:

List~1~ = \{A,B,C}

List~2~ = \{X,Y,Z,Q,R,S}

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|*A : X*
|*B : Y*
|*C : Z*
|*: Q*
|*: R*
|*: S*
|===

In the second scenario, the last three elements "Q", "R", and "S" are not affected and their value remains as if no association had been made.

A third scenario may arise which deserves mention. As in the list example above, elements "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F" in the first list would "pair-up" with elements "X", "Y", and "Z" in the second list. Again, no consideration is made to the type or value of the corresponding elements; it is the order and presence which controls the association process. This scenario could be expressed as follows:

List~1~ = \{A,B,C,D,E,F}

List~2~ = \{X,Y,Z}

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|*A : X*
|*B : Y*
|*C : Z*
|*D :*
|*E :*
|*F :*
|===

In the third scenario, the last three elements "D", "E", and "F" are not affected and their value remains the same as if no association had been made.

===== 3.6.2.1.8 Identifier type / assigning authority relationship

As stated earlier, the uniqueness of the identifiers included in a message can be determined by the combination of identifier type (t) and assigning authority (a). It is assumed that both sending system and receiving system can inspect both of these qualifiers as a message is constructed or processed. This method is used to determine the "tightly coupled" relationship between the identifiers. The implementation of this relationship exists between the _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ and the _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_. In other words, elements "B^t2^a1", "C^t3^a1", "D^t4^a1", "A^t1^a1", "E^t5^a1", and "F^t6^a1" in the first list would be associated with elements "X^t1^a1", "Y^t2^a1", and "Z^t3^a1 in the second list. This scenario could be expressed as follows:

List~1~ = \{B^t2^a1,C^t3^a1,D^t4^a1,A^t1^a1,E^t5^a1,F^t6^a1}

List~2~ = \{X^t1^a1,Y^t2^a1,Z^t3^a1}

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|*B^t2^a1 : Y^t2^a1*
|*C^t3^a1 : Z^t3^a1*
|*D^t4^a1 :*
|*A^t1^a1 : X^t1^a1*
|*E^t5^a1 :*
|*F^t6^a1 :*
|===

In this scenario, the three elements which do not have corresponding identifier type and assigning authority "D^t4^a1", "E^t5^a1", and "F^t6^a1" are not affected and their value remains the same as if no association had been made.

A second scenario may arise which deserves mention. In the case of identifier type and assigning authority definition, the elements "A^t1^a1", "B^t2^a1", and "C^t3^a1" in the first list would be associated with elements "X^t4^a1", "Y^t2^a1", "Z^t3^a1", "Q^t1^a1", "R^t5^a1", and "S^t6^a1" in the second list. No consideration is made to the order of the identifiers; it is the identifier type and assigning authority of the corresponding elements which controls the association process. This scenario could be expressed as follows:

List~1~ = \{A^t1^a1,B^t2^a1,C^t3^a1}

List~2~ = \{X^t4^a1,Y^t2^a1,Z^t3^a1, Q^t1^a1,R^t5^a1,S^t6^a1}

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|*A^t1^a1 : Q^t1^a1*
|*B^t2^a1 : Y^t2^a1*
|*C^t3^a1 : Z^t3^a1*
|*: X^t4^a1*
|*: R^t5^a1*
|*: S^t6^a1*
|===

In the second scenario, the three elements which do not have corresponding identifier type and assigning authority "X^t4^a1", "R^t5^a1", and "S^t6^a1" are not affected and their value remains the same as if no association had been made.

===== 3.6.2.1.9 Global merge and move message construct versus repeating segment message constructs

A flexible message construct is provided for merge trigger events. The message construct allows for a repeating set of PID, optional PD1, MRG, and optional PV1 segments as illustrated below:

MSH

EVN

\{ PID

{empty}[PD1]

MRG

{empty}[PV1]

}

Trigger events support the concept of a global move or merge, where all the subordinate identifiers are moved or merged. For example, the use case for A41 (merge account-patient account number) (Section _3.6.2.2.3_, "_A41 - merge account - patient account number (global)_") illustrates a merge on the patient account number (_PID-18 - Patient Account Number_). All subordinate identifiers (_PV1-19 - Visit Number_) are moved to the target _PID-18 - Patient Account Number Identifier_, even though they are not specified in the message.

A repeating segment message construct supports reporting of the subordinate identifiers using the repeating segments. This is illustrated in the use case for A40 (merge patient - patient identifier list) (Section _3.6.2.2.2_, "_A40 - merge patient - patient identifier list (repeating segment)_," A41 (merge account - patient account number) (Section _3.6.2.2.4_, "_A41 - merge account - patient account number (repeating segment)_"), and A45 (move visit information-visit number) (Section _3.6.2.2.9_ "_A45 - move visit information - visit number (repeating segment)_"). Specifying each subordinate ID in repeating segments is optional but not recommended. This construct can be used when renumbering of identifiers is necessary as illustrated in Sections _3.6.2.2.2_, "_A40 - merge patient - patient identifier list (repeating segment)_," _3.6.2.2.4_, "_A41 - merge account - patient account number (repeating segment)_," and _3.6.2.2.9_, "_A45 - move visit information - visit number (repeating segment)_," or to explicitly identify individual subordinate identifiers as illustrated in Section _3.6.2.2.9_, "_A45 - move visit information - visit number (repeating segment)_."

===== 3.6.2.1.10 Identifier renumbering

When renumbering of identifiers occurs, the repeating segment construct may be required in order to report identifier number changes. When renumbering occurs, the incorrect source identifier is specified in the MRG segment and the correct target identifier is reported in the PID or PV1 segment. Refer to the use case for A41 (merge account-patient account number) for an illustration.

===== 3.6.2.1.11 Superior identifier reporting

When merging or moving subordinate numbers, the higher level, "superior" identifiers should be included in the message. For example, when merging an account where the target is _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ and the source is _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_, the higher level patient identifiers (_PID-3 -Patient Identifier List_ and _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_) and person identifiers (_PID-2 - Patient ID_ and _MRG-4 - Prior Patient ID_) should also be reported in the message.

==== *3.6.2.2* Trigger events

The intent of trigger events A40 (merge patient- patient identifier list), A41 (merge account-patient account number), A42 (merge visit-visit number), A43 (move patient information-patient identifier list), A44 (move account information-patient account number), A45 (move visit information-visit number), A47 (change patient identifier list), A49 (change patient account number), A50 (change visit number), and A51 (change alternate visit ID) is to reconcile distinct sets of existing person/patient data records that have been entered under different identification numbers, either deliberately or because of errors. Ideally, following any of these trigger events, all of the person/patient data should be accessible under whatever surviving identifiers were specified in the messages. Because of substantial differences in database architectures and system-dependent data processing requirements or limitations, the exact meaning and implementation of these events must be negotiated between systems.

|A40 - Merge patient - patient identifier list |
|Use Case - During the admission process, the registrar does not find a record for patient EVE EVERYWOMAN in the ADT system and creates a new record with patient identifier MR2. EVE EVERYWOMAN has actually been to the healthcare facility several times in the past under her maiden name, Eve Maidenname with patient identifier MR1. The problem persists for a while. During that time, several more accounts are assigned to Eve under her newly created patient ID MR2. Finally, the problem is discovered and Medical Records merges her two charts together leaving patient identifier MR1. All the accounts (ACCT1, ACCT2) that were assigned to MR2 are combined under MR1 as a result. |
|Target: _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ (Note: _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ is not valued; all accounts associated with MR2 are combined under MR1). To merge _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ data only, use event A41 (merge account-patient account number). To move _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ data use event A44 (move account information-patient account number). |

Implementation considerations: This scenario exists when two medical records are established for the same person.

Since there could be a discrepancy in the demographic information between the two records, reconciliation may be required. In the example above, the implementation allowed the older demographic information (in the PID) to survive. The demographics implied by the IDs in the MRG segment, did not survive. Surviving and non-surviving demographic information is application and implementation specific. An A08 (update patient information) event should be sent and/or negotiated as necessary to provide for implementation and application-specific needs.

=== 3.6.3 Patient record links

Linking two or more patients does not require the actual merging of patient information as discussed in Section link:#merging-patientperson-information[_3.6.2_], "link:#merging-patientperson-information[_Merging patient/person information_];" following a link trigger event, sets of affected patient data records should remain distinct. However, because of differences in database architectures, there may be system-dependent limitations or restrictions regarding the linking of one or more patients that must be negotiated.

There are multiple approaches for implementing Master Patient Indexes. It is useful for the purpose of MPI mediation to support two types of linkage. Explicit linkage requires a message declaring a link has been made between multiple identifiers. Implicit linkage is performed when a receiving system infers the linkage from the presence of multiple identifiers present in _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_.

In an MPI setting, the A24 -link patient information message is preferred for transmitting an explicit link of identifiers whether they are in the same or different assigning authorities. The A37 unlink patient information message is preferred for transmitting the explicit unlinking of identifiers.

Implicit linkage of identifiers, sometimes called passive linking, has been implemented using various messages. An acknowledged method is inclusion of multiple identifiers in _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_, which the receiving system implicitly links. An MPI or application that makes such an implicit linkage can generate an A24 - link patient information message to explicitly notify another system of this action.

=== 3.6.4 MPI Integration - an introduction

The purpose of this section is to provide some insight into how HL7 committees have approached the area of MPI integration, as well as to provide concrete examples of how the integration could be done using messages in Version 2.4 and later.

==== *3.6.4.0* (hidden text)

==== *3.6.4.1* Definitions - what is an MPI?

There can be quite a bit of confusion as to what defines an MPI. Early definitions called it a Master Patient Index, implying only patient data would be managed. Later the definition was expanded to mean persons in general, including patients, guarantors, subscribers, and even providers; essentially any entity that could be considered a "person." Thus the current acronym MPI generally is inferred to mean Master Person Index.

An MPI is generally used to manage person identification and cross-reference across disparate systems. Healthcare organizations may have several systems handling various different data processing needs, from laboratory to billing, each with its own database of persons and person identifier numbering schemes. Each of these can be called an ID Domain. An MPI can function as a Correlation Manager between these domains, providing a cross-reference of a person's identifiers across each of the domains. Typically an MPI will also have one universal or enterprise identifier that uniquely identifies the person in the MPI itself. The domain for this identifier may or may not be the domain for clients of the MPI.

MPI functionality also typically includes methods to provide an identifier for a person, given a set of traits or demographics for that person. An example of the use of this is for a client system to query the MPI for a person given a set of demographics. The MPI uses matching algorithms to find possible matching persons, and returns to the client system the identifiers for those persons.

This section currently deals only with MPI functionality related to persons in the context of Version 2.4 and later. It is assuming integration using Version 2.4 and later ADT messages, and the functionality surrounding finding and identifying a person.

==== *3.6.4.2* HL7 and CORBAmed PIDS

There has been an effort to harmonize the modeling work that has been done in the CORBAMed Patient Identification Service (PIDS) with the HL7 message set, with an eye toward HL7 Version 3.0. You may see evidence of CORBAMed modeling in this implementation, but that should not be taken as evidence that full harmonization has taken place. There is much work left to do in this area.

==== *3.6.4.3* MPI QUERY for person lookup and identification

Several QBP/RSP queries have been developed to aid in the integration of systems with an MPI. They consist of several Qxx/Kxx trigger/response pairs and one Q24/K24 trigger/response pair. The following table lists their functions:

MPI QBP/RSP Queries

[width="100%",cols="15%,28%,57%",]
|===
|Query |Name |MPI Use
|Q21/K21 |Get Person Demographics |Given a person identifier, return the PID and optionally the PD1 segments for the matching person.
|Q22/K22 |Find Candidates |Given some demographics, optionally a match threshold and algorithm, find and return a list of matching persons.
|Q23/K23 |Get Corresponding Identifiers |Given a person's identifier and a list of identifier domains, return the person's identifiers in those domains.
|Q24/K24 |Allocate Identifiers |Given a list of identifier domains, return new identifiers for those domains. Should not link to a person, just reserve and return identifiers.
|===

The following sections show several scenarios involving looking up a person on a "client" system, and how it can be integrated to an MPI. The basic flow is for a user to enter person information on the client system, and the client system using services of the MPI to match the user's input to a person that exists somewhere on the two systems.

The scenarios are differentiated on two variables:

*ID Creator -* Which system assigns new person identifiers for the client system. This can either be the MPI or the client system.

*Person Existence -* On which system the person record currently exists - the client system, the MPI, or both.

==== *3.6.4.4* Client system assigns identifier, person exists on MPI only

In this scenario, a client system (e.g., a registration system) will query an MPI for a person that does not currently exist on the client system. The MPI returns a list of one or more possible matching candidates, and one is chosen by the user on the client system. The client system assigns the person an identifier and an update is sent to the MPI to notify it of the new assigned identifier.

image:extracted-media/media/image5.wmf[extracted-media/media/image5]

===== 3.6.4.4.1 *Figure 3-1* - Client system assigns identifier, person exists on MPI only

The messages are defined as follows:

*Q22/K22 Find Candidates* - This signals the MPI to search its database for a list of persons that match the demographic criteria sent in the query, using whatever algorithms it has at its disposal, or using the algorithm optionally specified in the query. The response includes a list of "candidates" that matched the criteria in the query, one PID segment for each candidate. The query can also specify the identifier domains to return in _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_, so that the client system identifier and the MPI enterprise identifier could be returned for each match.

*Q21/K21 Get Person Demographics* - Once a candidate is chosen from the list, another query may be done to retrieve the full set of demographics for that person.

*A24 or A01/A04/A05* - This transaction is to update the MPI with the new identifier the client system has created for the person. It is acceptable for systems to simply send _an A01 Admit/visit notification,_ _A04 Register a patient or A05 Pre-admit a patient_ as may have been done traditionally, with the new client system identifier and the existing MPI enterprise identifier in PID-3. However an _A24 Link patient information_ may be sent instead, with one PID segment containing the MPI enterprise identifier for the person, and the second PID segment containing the new registration system identifier.

==== *3.6.4.5* Client system assigns identifier, person exists on both systems

In this scenario, a client system (e.g., a registration system) will query an MPI for a person, and the person record exists on both systems. The MPI returns a list of possible matching candidates, and one is chosen by the user on the client system. The client system simply asks the MPI for an updated set of demographics and does not assign an identifier since the person already exists with an identifier on the client system.

Prior to querying the MPI, the client system may query its own database to reduce network transactions. However, the full searching capabilities of the MPI may be preferred to the client system in order to prevent the selection of the wrong person.

image:extracted-media/media/image6.emf[extracted-media/media/image6,width=504,height=480]

===== 3.6.4.5.1 *Figure 3-2* - Client system assigns identifier, person exists on both systems

The message flow is identical to the message flow in the 3.6.4.5 example, with the exception that the final update to the MPI is not needed in order to give the MPI a new identifier for the person. The MPI should already have the client system identifier from previous transactions.

An ADT event may be sent later by the client system simply to update the MPI with any demographic changes that occur.

==== *3.6.4.6* Client system assigns identifier, person exists on neither system

In this scenario, a client system (e.g., a registration system) will query an MPI for a person, and the person does not exist on either system. The MPI returns a list of possible matching candidates, or possibly an empty list. The user does _not_ choose one, and a new person record is created.

image:extracted-media/media/image7.emf[extracted-media/media/image7,width=584,height=440]

===== 3.6.4.6.1 *Figure 3-3* - Client system assigns identifier, does not exist on either system

The message flow again begins with a _Q22/K22_ _Find Candidates_ query. The response may or may not contain a list of candidates.

If the client system assigns a person identifier when the record is created, an _A28 Add person information_ could be sent to the MPI to notify it of the record creation. If the client system does not create an identifier until the registration is completed, the A01, A04 or A05 events could serve the purpose of notifying the MPI of an added person and identifier. The fact that the person will have an identifier unknown to the MPI, and no enterprise identifier, will allow the MPI to infer that a person record is being added.

When the person record is added to the MPI with the new identifier, an enterprise identifier is assigned, and ancillary systems may be notified of the new person record creation.

==== *3.6.4.7* MPI assigns identifier, person exists on MPI

In the next set of three scenarios, it is assumed that a third party (ID Manager) creates identifiers for the client system, and for these examples the MPI fulfills this role. The QBP/RSP queries support this service.

image:extracted-media/media/image8.emf[extracted-media/media/image8,width=624,height=304]

===== 3.6.4.7.1 *Figure 3-4* - Example of two healthcare organizations merging

Figure 3-4 shows a case where identifiers may need to be assigned by a third party. In the example, East Health Organization had one identifier domain (XXXX numbers) for both the hospital registration system and the outpatient clinic registration numbers. Coordination was done through the use of pre-printed charts for new patients, which prevented the two systems from using the same XXXX number for two patients.

Later West Health Organization is bought and merged with East. West has been using its own identifier domain (YYYY numbers). An MPI is also implemented to keep a cross-reference between the two systems, and assigns its own enterprise identifier (EEEE number) to each patient.

Because the organization is attempting to go paperless, East decides to forgo its pre-printed charts, but still keep the XXXX numbers. Since the pre-printed charts are no longer there to keep numbers from being re-used between the hospital and clinic, a third party is needed to assign the XXXX numbers.

A patient arrives at East Hospital that had never been there, but had been to West previously. To register the patient, the hospital system submits a Find Candidates Q22/K22 query to get from the MPI a list of possible matching patients. The user finds the patient since she had been to West previously. Since the patient is new to East, she must be given a new East identifier (XXXX number). An Allocate Identifiers A56/K24 query is sent from the East Hospital to the MPI and the MPI generates an XXXX number and returns it. Later when the registration is finished, an A24 Link Person Information message is sent to notify the MPI that the allocated identifier has been assigned to a patient

In the following first scenario, the person record exists on the MPI, however it does not exist on the client system. The message flow assumes that the MPI is assigning identifiers for the client system that are not the enterprise identifiers. If this were not the case, the Allocate Identifiers A56/K24 query would not be needed.

____
image:extracted-media/media/image9.wmf[extracted-media/media/image9]
____

===== 3.6.4.7.2 *Figure 3-5* - MPI assigns identifier, person exists on MPI

The message flow is similar to previous examples, with the exception of the _Q24/K24 Allocate Identifiers_ query and the final _A24 Link Patient Information_ message:

*Q24/K24 Allocate Identifiers* - This query is for the client system to ask the MPI for an identifier in the client system's domain. It is not to assign the identifier to a particular person record, but rather just to reserve an identifier for later use.

*A24 Link patient information* - This message is to notify the MPI that the previously allocated identifier has been assigned to a person. The A24 should include one PID segment with the new identifier and one PID segment with the MPI enterprise identifier.

==== *3.6.4.8* MPI assigns identifier, person exists on both systems

is scenario is identical to the scenario in 3.5.4.2 Client system assigns identifier, person exists on both systems.

===== 3.6.4.8.1 *Figure 3- 6* - MPI assigns identifier, person exists on both systems

==== *3.6.4.9* MPI assigns identifier, person exists on neither system

In this scenario, the person does not exist on either system. The message flow is similar to _3.6.4.7_, "_MPI assigns identifier, person exists on MPI_"; however, there is no need for the _Q21/K21Get person Demographics_ query as a double-check for the user since the person does not exist on the MPI. Also, after the person is registered and the identifier assigned, an _A28 Add Person Information_ is sent to the MPI to have it add the person to its database and assign an enterprise identifier.

image:extracted-media/media/image10.wmf[extracted-media/media/image10]

===== 3.6.4.9.1 *Figure 3-7* - MPI assigns identifier, person exists on neither system

=== 3.6.5 Usage notes: Non-human PID patient identification

The species attribute is required for non-human patients. The breed and strain attributes are conditional. Thus if the strain attribute is populated, the species attribute must be populated, but the breed attribute is optional. The production class attribute is optional, but if populated the species attribute must also be populated. The name of the animal populates the PID-5 attribute, component 2. The last name of the owner may populate component 1 of PID-5. Owner information is transmitted in the NK1 segment.
