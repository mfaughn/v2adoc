Definition: One or more coded entries identifying the protocol according to which the Scheduled Procedure Step shall be performed. Protocol Code(s) may identify particular equipment settings as well as operatorâ€™s manipulations. Refer to Table 0605 - Protocol Code in Chapter 2C for valid values.

A Protocol is a specification of actions prescribed by a Procedure Plan to perform a specific Procedure Step. A Scheduled Procedure Step contains only one Protocol that may be conveyed by one or more Protocol Codes. Typically, the code or codes identifying Protocol instance would be selected from a catalog of protocols established locally or provided by equipment manufacturers or professional organizations. Multiple Protocols may not exist in one Scheduled Procedure Step. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0040,0008) that conveys information identical to components one through three of this field.

A limit of sixteen (16) characters for the first component and sixty-four (64) characters for the second component is required to allow compatibility with DICOM.
