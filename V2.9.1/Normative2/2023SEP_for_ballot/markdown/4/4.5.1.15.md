#### 4.5.1.15 ORC-15 Order Effective Date/Time (DTM) 00229

Definition: This field focuses on when the information communicated is to take effect. It is most appropriate when used on an order that is by nature a “continuing” (or continuous) order. This field has a close relationship to ORC-9 and the TQ1, TQ2 segments in so much as the value in ORC-15 takes precedence over both. For example, an order is placed on June 1, for an activity that is to be performed over ten days as indicated in the TQ1 segment. The Filler then receives a cancel message on June 2 with the ORC-9 value of June 2, but the ORC-15 Order Effective Date/Time indicated the cancel is to be effective on June 7th. ORC-15 by taking precedence over TQ1 and ORC-9, would tell the Filler to continue to perform the order event until June 7, and cancel all remaining events (treatment, procedures etc..) after that time. If the order identified in the ORC has children, the children which have not started should be canceled; if there is a child in process, it should be discontinued; if a child has progressed beyond the point where it can be discontinued, its status is unaffected.
