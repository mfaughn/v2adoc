#### 4.5.4.4 TQ1-4 Explicit Time (TM) 01630

Definition: This field explicitly lists the actual times referenced by the code in TQ1-3. This field will be used to clarify the TQ1-3 in cases where the actual administration times vary within an institution. If the time of the service request spans more than a single day, this field is only practical if the same times of administration occur for each day of the service request. If the actual start time of the service request (as given by TQ1-7) is after the first explicit time, the first administration is taken to be the first explicit time after the start time. In the case where the patient moves to a location having a different set of explicit times, the existing service request may be updated with a new quantity/timing segment showing the changed explicit times.

Usage Note: This field is not valued if a _Repeat Pattern_ is not present.
