#### 4.5.3.25 OBR-25 Result Status (ID) 00258

Definition: This field contains the status of results for this order. This conditional field is required whenever the OBR is contained in a report message. It is not required as part of an initial order.

There are two methods of sending status information. If the status is that of the entire order, use ORC-15-order effective date/time and ORC-5-order status. If the status pertains to the order detail segment, use OBR-25-result status and OBR-22-results rpt/status chng – date/time. If both are present, the OBR values override the ORC values.

This field would typically be used in a response to an order status query where the level of detail requested does not include the OBX segments. When the individual status of each result is necessary, OBX-11-observ result status may be used.
