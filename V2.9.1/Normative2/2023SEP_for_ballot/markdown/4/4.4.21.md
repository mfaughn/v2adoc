### 4.4.21 ORX â€“ General Order Message with Document Payload Acknowledgement Message (Event O58) 

The function of this message is to respond to an OMQ message. An ORX message is the application acknowledgment to an OMQ message. See Chapter 2 for a description of the acknowledgment paradigm.

In ORX the PID and ORC segments are optional, particularly in case of an error response. However, ORC segments are always required in ORD when the OBR is present. For example, a response ORD might include only the MSH and MSA.

The function (e.g., cancel, new order) of both OMQ and ORX messages is determined by the value in ORC-1-order control. (See the table of order control values for a complete list.)
