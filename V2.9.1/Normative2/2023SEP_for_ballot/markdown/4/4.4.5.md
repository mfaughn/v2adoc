### 4.4.5 ORG â€“ general clinical order acknowledgement message (event O20) 

The function of this message is to respond to an OMG message. An ORG message is the application acknowledgment to an OMG message. See Chapter 2 for a description of the acknowledgment paradigm.

In ORG the PID and ORC segments are optional, particularly in case of an error response. However, ORC segments are always required in ORG when the OBR is present. For example, a response ORG might include only the MSH and MSA.

The function (e.g., cancel, new order) of both OMG and ORG messages is determined by the value in ORC-1-order control. (See the table of order control values for a complete list.)

| ORG^O20^ORG_O20 |  |  |  |
| Field name | Field Value: Original mode | Field Value: Enhanced Mode |  |

| MSH-16 | Blank | NE | NE |
| Immediate Ack | ACK^O20^ACK | - | ACK^O20^ACK |
| Application Ack | - | - | - |

There is not supposed to be an Application Level acknowledgement to an Application Level Acknowledgement message. In Enhanced Mode, MSH-16 SHALL always be set to NE (Never).
