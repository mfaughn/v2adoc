### 4.6.1 An order replaced by three orders

Suppose that an application called "PC" is sending an order to the EKG application for three EKGs to be done on successive days.

The order might be placed as follows:

ORM message:

PID|...&lt;cr>

ORC|NW|A226677^PC||946281^PC||N|3^QAM||200601121132|444-44-4444^HIPPOCRATES^HAROLD^^^^MD|||4EAST|...&lt;cr>

There is a group number first component indicating that an order group is being created.

Responses: Because the EKG application must turn the single order above into three orders for three separate EKGs (services), the results of each will be reported under its own OBR segment. Several response levels are possible depending on the Response Flag:

a) If the Response Flag is N (as it is), then the filler EKG application only responds "I got the order."

MSH|...&lt;cr>

MSA|...&lt;cr>

The only implication of this response is that the order was received.

If the Response Flag had been E, then the response would have been the same, but its implication would have been that the EKG application had processed all the orders and they were acceptable.

b) If the Response Flag were R, then the filler EKG application must communicate to the PC the fact of the creation of child orders, but with no details:

What has been said here is "Your A226767 has spun out three children named 89‑551, 89‑552, and 89‑553." Notice that the placer order numbers are identical in the children’s ORCs.

c) If the Response Flag were D, then the filler EKG application must communicate to the PC application the fact of the replacement and also the exact replacement order segments:

Here the actual OBR segments have been added.

The status of the child orders is being reported as SC (scheduled).

ORC-7-quantity/timing shows that the EKGs are requested after 0500 on successive days.
