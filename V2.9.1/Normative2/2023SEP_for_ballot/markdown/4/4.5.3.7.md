#### 4.5.3.7 OBR-7 Observation Date/Time (DTM) 00241

Definition: This field is the clinically relevant date/time of the observation. In the case of observations taken directly from a subject, it is the actual date and time the observation was obtained. In the case of a specimenâ€‘associated study, this field shall represent the date and time the specimen was collected or obtained. (This is a results-only field except when the placer or a third party has already drawn the specimen.) This field is conditionally required. When the OBR is transmitted as part of a report message, the field **must** be filled in. If it is transmitted as part of a request **and** a sample has been sent along as part of the request, this field must be filled in because this specimen time is the physiologically relevant date/time of the observation.
