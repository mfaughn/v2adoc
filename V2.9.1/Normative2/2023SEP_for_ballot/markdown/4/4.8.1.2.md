Definition: When blank, the modifier applies to all service periods. Diet orders, for example, typically apply to all service periods. This field usually specifies supplements. This field allows you to designate a modification for one or more of the service periods during a day by combining service specifications as needed. The service periods will be local CEs, normally numbers. Suggested are:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| service 1 | is | breakfast |
| service 2 | is | mid-morning snack |
| service 3 | is | lunch |
| service 4 | is | mid-afternoon snack |
| service 5 | is | dinner |
| service 6 | is | bedtime snack |

Ex: |1~5| means service 1 and service 5, whatever these are locally defined to be.

Refer to Table 0627 - Service Period in Chapter 2C for valid values.
