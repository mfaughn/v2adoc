#### 4.5.1.36 ORC-36 Order Status Date Range (DR) 03509

Components: &lt;Range Start Date/Time (DTM)> ^ &lt;Range End Date/Time (DTM)>

Definition: This field is a Filler assigned date/time indicating a date range that the ORC-5 Order Status is intended to be effective. For example, if the Filler recommends an alternate test, and sets the ORC-5 status to “Hold”, this date/time reflects how long the Filler will keep the order in that status (Barring additional communications from the Placer or Filler in regard to this order.) When the date is outside the specified order status date range, ORC-5 (Order Status) should be considered an unspecified status, i.e., the status represented in ORC-5 would not necessarily be reflective of the actual status anymore.
