#### 4.5.3.22 OBR-22 Results Rpt/Status Chng â€“ Date/Time (DTM) 00255

Definition: This field specifies the date/time when the results were reported or status changed. This conditional field is required whenever the OBR-25 is valued. This field is used to indicate the date and time that the results are composed into a report and released, or that a status, as defined in ORC-5 order status, is entered or changed. (This is a results field only.) When other applications (such as office or clinical database applications) query the laboratory application for un-transmitted results, the information in this field may be used to control processing on the communications link. Usually, the ordering service would want only those results for which the reporting date/time is greater than the date/time the inquiring application last received results.
