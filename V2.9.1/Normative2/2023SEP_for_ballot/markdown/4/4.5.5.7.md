Definition: Indicates if this service request is the first, last, service request in a cyclic series of service requests. If null or not present, this field indicates that the current service request is neither the first or last service request in a cyclic series of service requests. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70505[HL7 Table 0505 – Cyclic Entry/Exit Indicator] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for allowed values.

Conditional Rule: Should not be populated when TQ2-2 (Sequence/Results Flag) is not equal to a 'C' (cyclic service request).

Example of TQ2 - 6, 7, & 8 Usage:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example | Translation |
| ...\ | ES\ |
| *\ | +10^min\ |
| ... | translates to: execute this service request the first time without evaluating the condition specified in the TQ2 segment; but repeat only its execution when the specified external service request’s start or finish date/time has met this condition. This specification generates a repetition of the service request for each iteration of the cycle. |

**Note:** This requires that the requesting application be able to specify the placer/filler/placer group number of the last service request in the cycle in the first service request’s quantity/timing specification.
