## 17.5 Inventory Item Master Messages Segments

This section describes the segments described in the Inventory Item Master File Message (Event M15) and Inventory Item Master File Message - Enhanced (Event M16) master file messages. The description of these events and the messages structures are published in Chapter 8, Master Files. The M15 Inventory Item Master File trigger event and the IIM inventory item master segment is a limited implementation. The M16 Inventory Item Master File - Enhanced trigger event is a comprehensive Materials Management message.

The enhanced inventory item master message communicates additions and updates of supply items and their attributes from a general supply location to additional supply locations within a healthcare facility.

The general supply inventory location sends a transaction to multiple inventory locations with this trigger event, communicating adds and changes to item master catalog and inventory supply items.

The ILT segment formerly published in v2.5 Chapter 8, Master Files, will now be published in this chapter because of its use in the Materials Management domain.
