#### 17.4.2.14 Sterilization

The process used to render a product free from viable microorganisms.

> **Note:** In a sterilization process, the nature of a microbiological death is described by an exponential function. Therefore, the presence of microorganisms on any individual item can be expressed in terms of probability. While this probability can be reduced to a very low number, it can never be reduced to zero.
