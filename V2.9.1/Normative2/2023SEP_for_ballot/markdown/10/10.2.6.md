### 10.2.6 Organization of This Chapter: Trigger Events and Message Definitions

This specification contains three functional groupings of trigger events and message definitions. The trigger events within each of the three functional groupings share the same or similar message definitions. For clarity, message definitions shared by multiple trigger events are presented only once.

The first functional grouping of trigger events and message definitions describes _placer request transactions_. This grouping defines the trigger events and message definitions for transactions from applications acting in a placer application role, and also defines the related filler application response messages. These messages are described in Section _10.3_, "_PLACER APPLICATION REQUESTS AND TRIGGER EVENTS_."

The second functional grouping describes trigger events and message definitions for _unsolicited transactions_ from applications acting in the filler application role. This grouping describes the unsolicited messages originating from an application fulfilling the filler role, and the response messages sent back by applications fulfilling the auxiliary role. These messages are described in Section _10.4_, "_FILLER APPLICATION MESSAGES AND TRIGGER EVENTS UNSOLICITED_."

The final grouping describes _query transactions_ from applications acting in the querying application role, and also defines the _related filler application messages_ used to respond to these queries. These messages are described in section _10.5_, "_QUERY TRANSACTIONS AND TRIGGER EVENTS_."

The notation used to describe the sequence, optionality, and repetition of segments is described in Chapter 2, "Format for defining abstract messages."
