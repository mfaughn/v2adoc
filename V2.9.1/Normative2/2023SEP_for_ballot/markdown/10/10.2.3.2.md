#### 10.2.3.2 Status

The status of a scheduled activity describes where that activity is in its life cycle. A status differs from a trigger event in an important way: a status describes the current condition of an entity, whereas a trigger event is generated to "move" the entity from one state to another. All status fields in this chapter are defined with respect to the application acting in the role of a filler, unless otherwise (and specifically) indicated. Therefore, a status in a scheduling interface transaction is only truly meaningful if the transaction was generated by the application assigning or maintaining that status.

Typical statuses for a schedule transaction might include the following: pending, wait-listed, confirmed, canceled, discontinued, deleted, started, completed, overbooked (booked for a resource along with another conflicting appointment), blocked, etc.
