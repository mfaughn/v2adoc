#### 10.6.4.4 AIS-4 Start Date/Time (DTM) 01202

Definition: This field contains the date and time this service needs for the appointment. This field allows the application to identify that the service is required for the appointment at a different time than the appointment’s start date/time.

This field is conditionally required. If a value for _AIS-5-Start Date/Time Offset_ is not provided, then a value is required for this field. To specify that there is no difference between the appointment’s start date/time and the resource’s start date/time either replicate the appointment’s start date/time into this field, or specify an offset of zero (0) in _AIS-5-Start Date/Time Offset_ and any valid time unit code in _AIS-6-Start Date/Time Offset Units_.
