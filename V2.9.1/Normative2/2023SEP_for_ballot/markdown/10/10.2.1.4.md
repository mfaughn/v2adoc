#### 10.2.1.4 Parent and Child Appointments

Parent appointments are those appointments that embody one or more child appointments. For example, a request for a repeating appointment results in a logical parent (the original scheduled appointment request), and one or more children (each individual occurrence of the appointment). This specification provides no information about how individual applications store or handle parent and child appointments, but it does provide a mechanism for identifying individual occurrences (children) within transactions.

Either the placing application or the filling application can specify child appointmentsâ€”and in one of two ways. If each individual child appointment is assigned a separate and unique Placer Appointment ID and/or Filler Appointment ID, then that unique identifier may be used in transactions to specify an individual child. If, however, neither the placer nor filler application assigns a unique identifier separately, an occurrence number can be used. Both the ARQ and SCH segments allow for an occurrence number, which is a unique serial number assigned to each child within a parent appointment.
