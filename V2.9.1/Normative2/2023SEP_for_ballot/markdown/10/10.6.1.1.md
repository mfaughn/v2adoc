#### 10.6.1.1 ARQ-1 Placer Appointment ID (EI) 00860

Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)> ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)> ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains placer application’s permanent identifier for the appointment request (and the scheduled appointment itself, when confirmed as booked by the filler application). This is a composite field. The first component is a string that identifies an individual appointment request, or booked appointment. It is assigned by the placer application, and it identifies an appointment request, and the subsequent scheduled appointment, uniquely among all such requests and/or booked appointments from a particular requesting application. If the placer appointment ID identifies a parent of a repeating schedule request, then the individual scheduled child appointments can be uniquely identified either by a new placer appointment ID or the parent’s placer appointment ID plus an occurrence number, specified in _ARQ-3-Occurrence number._

The second through fourth components contain the assigning authority identifying information.
