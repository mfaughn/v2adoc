#### 10.6.2.24 SCH-24 Parent Filler Appointment ID (EI) 00882

Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)> ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)> ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field relates a child to its parent, when a parent-child relationship exists. It contains the filler application’s permanent identifier for the parent of the appointment request. This is a composite field.

The first component is a string that identifies the parent appointment request. It is assigned by the filler application, and it identifies an appointment request uniquely among all such requests on a particular processing application.

This is a conditionally required field. On initial messages where a filler has not yet assigned a filler appointment ID, this field should not contain a value. In all other subsequent messages, where a filler application has assigned a filler appointment ID, this field is required.
