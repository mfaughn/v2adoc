#### 10.6.4.5 AIS-5 Start Date/Time Offset (NM) 00891

Definition: This field contains the offset this service needs for the appointment, expressed in units of time relative to the scheduled start date/time. This field allows the application to identify that the service is required for the appointment at a different time than the appointment’s start date/time. The first component contains the offset amount. An offset of zero (0), or an unvalued field indicates that the service is required at the start date/time of the appointment.

A positive offset (an unsigned or positive number) indicates that the service is required after the appointment’s start date/time. Specifying a negative offset indicates that the service is required prior to the specified start date/time of the appointment. Negative offsets are allowed, and sites should clearly define the effect of a negative offset on the appointment’s start date/time.

This field is conditionally required. If a value for _AIS-5-Start Date/Time Offset_ is not provided, then a value is required for this field. To specify that there is no difference between the appointment’s start date/time and the resource’s start date/time either replicate the appointment’s start date/time into this field, or specify an offset of zero (0) in _AIS-5-Start Date/Time Offset_ and any valid time unit code in _AIS-6-Start Date/Time Offset Units_.
