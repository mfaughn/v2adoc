#### 10.2.1.3 Appointments

Appointments are instances of the performance of a service or the use of a resource. They describe the "why," the "who" and the "when" in any communication of scheduling transactions. These appointments occupy one or more slots on a service or resource schedule, causing those slots to become unavailable or "booked." Appointments can describe scheduled activities related to patients in a healthcare setting, or they can describe scheduled activities wholly unrelated to patients.

In its simplest form, an appointment consists of one service or resource reserved for a period of time, for a specific reason. More complex activities involve multiple services or resources, or parent-child relationships to other appointments.

The primary attributes for the appointment which describes a scheduled activity include the following:

• A unique placer appointment identification code\
\
The placer appointment identification code uniquely describes an instance of an appointment. It is used in communications between placer and filler applications to identify a particular appointment (or a request for an appointment booking) on the placer application. Except in special circumstances, the code is assigned by the placer application upon making an initial scheduling request. This concept is similar in practice to the placer order number found in Chapter 4, Order Entry.

• A unique filler appointment identification code\
\
The filler appointment identification code uniquely describes an instance of an appointment. It is the filler application’s counter-part to the placer appointment identification code. It is used in communications between placer and filler applications to identify a particular appointment (or request for an appointment booking) on the filler application. Except under special circumstances, it is assigned by the filler application when an appointment (or a request for an appointment booking) is created by the filler application. This concept is similar in practice to the filler order number found in Chapter 4, Order Entry.

• An appointment start date and time\
\
The appointment start date and time describe the beginning of the appointment. In request transactions, the appointment start date and time are expressed as a preference or list of preferences. The filler application uses this expression of preference to book the appointment. Once an appointment has been booked, the start date and time are expressed in the actual scheduled start date and time.

• An appointment duration\
\
The appointment duration describes how long the appointment will last, and consequently, the end date and time of the appointment.

Supporting information about service and resource activities includes the following:

• Reason codes to describe the reason that the service is occurring or the resource is being used;

• Patient information to describe for whom the appointment is taking place, whether the appointment or scheduled activity is for, or related to, a patient;

• Requestor information to describe the person responsible for initiating and executing the appointment;

• Location information to describe where the appointment is scheduled to occur.

Other attributes further describe appointments. These attributes are communicated as necessary in transactions between applications.
