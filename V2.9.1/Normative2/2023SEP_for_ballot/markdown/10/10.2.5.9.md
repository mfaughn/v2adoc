#### 10.2.5.9 Querying Application

A querying application neither exerts control over nor requests changes to a schedule. Rather than accepting unsolicited information about schedules, as does an auxiliary application, the querying application actively solicits this information using a query mechanism. It will be driven by a person wanting information about schedules, and may be part of an application filling the placer application role as defined in this chapter. The information that the querying application receives is valid only at the exact time that the query results are generated by the filler application. Changes made to the schedule after the query results have been returned are not communicated to the querying application until it issues another query transaction.
