Definition: This field contains the identifier code for the reason that the appointment is to take place. This field may contain a Universal Service ID describing the observation/test/battery/procedure or other activity that is to be performed during the requested appointment, similar to the Universal Service ID defined for the OBR segment in Chapter 4 on Order Entry. It may also contain a site-specific code describing a pre-defined set of reasons that an appointment may be set to occur. This code can be based on local and/or universal codes. The use of universal codes is recommended. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70276[_User-defined Table 0276 - Appointment reason codes_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. This table provides codes for appointment reasons such as routine appointment, previously unscheduled walk-in visit, etc.
