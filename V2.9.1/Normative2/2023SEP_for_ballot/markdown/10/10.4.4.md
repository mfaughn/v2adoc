### 10.4.4 Notification of Appointment Cancellation (Event S15)

A notification of appointment cancellation is sent by the filler application to other applications when an existing appointment has been canceled. A cancel event is used to stop a valid appointment from taking place. For example, if a patient scheduled for an exam cancels his/her appointment, then the appointment is canceled on the filler application.

This trigger event can be used to cancel a parent appointment, in which none of the children of the appointment have either begun or been completed. Any child appointments that exist on the filler and placer applications should be considered canceled. If one or more child appointments have begun or have been completed, then this trigger event should not be used. Instead, the S16 (notification of appointment discontinuation) event should be used.
