### 10.3.5 Request Appointment Discontinuation (Event S05)

The request appointment discontinuation is sent by the placer application to the filler application to request that an appointment in progress be stopped, or that the remaining occurrences of a parent appointment not occur as scheduled. If none of the child appointments of a parent appointment have occurred, then a cancel trigger event should be sent instead. If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned, optionally containing an SCH segment and related detail segments describing the discontinued appointment.
