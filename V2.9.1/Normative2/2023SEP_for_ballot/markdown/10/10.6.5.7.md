Definition: This field contains the units of the resource requested, whose quantity is given in the preceding field. This field should be valued according to the recommendations in Chapters 2 and 7. If this field is not valued, the unit of each (code "ea") will be assumed. Refer to Chapter 7, Figures 7-6 through 7-9, for a list of ISO+ and ANS+ unit codes.

As of v2.6, the known applicable external coding systems include those in the table below. If the code set you are using is in this table, then you must use that designation.
