### 10.4.7 Notification of Addition of Service/Resource on Appointment (Event S18)

The notification of addition of service/resource is triggered on the filler application when a new service or resource has been added to an existing appointment. Services and resources are represented by the AIS, AIG, AIL, and AIP segments on an HL7 scheduling interface transaction. This trigger event should only be used for appointments that have not been completed, or for parent appointments whose children have not been completed.
