Definition: This field transmits a code that represents a high level categorization of resources. This is a companion field for the _STF-4 Staff Type_ and allows an institution or enterprise to impose a one or more super category levels. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70771[_User-defined Table 0771 – Resource Type or Category_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. This table contains no suggested values.

An enterprise might have more than one method to categorize or type resources at a high level. Therefore, this field can repeat.

Example: An organization may define discreet staff types (e.g., Pediatric Oncologist, Gerontologist, Oncology Pharmacist, Pediatric Pharmacist, Critical Care Nurse, Nurse Case Manager – Cardiology) as well as broad categories (e.g., Physician, Pharmacist, Nurse, Pediatric, Oncology, Cardiology, Case Management, Nephrology). Employing STF-4 for the discreet terms and STF-39 for the more generic terms allows both the levels of granularity to be apply to the staff without confusing the specific types with generic types. Thus, one may see:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| STF-4 | STF-39 |
| • Custodian | • Staff |
| • Non-clinical Nursing Supervisor | • Manager |
| • Pediatric Oncologist | • Physician ~ Pediatrics ~ Oncology |
| • Gerontologist | • Physician |
| • Oncology Pharmacist | • Pharmacist ~ Oncology |
| • Pediatric Pharmacist | • Pediatrics ~ Pharmacist |
| • Critical Care Nurse | • Nurse |
| • Nurse Case Manager – Cardiology | • Nurse ~ Cardiology ~ Case Management |
