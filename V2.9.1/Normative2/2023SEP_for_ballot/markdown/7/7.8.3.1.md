Definition: This field contains the time point for which some instance of data for the clinical trial was scheduled. The time point may be expressed in any coded format. Some examples of time point values are: **Prestudy, Pretreatment, 4 times/day, Weekly, Every 3 days, Every course, At Relapse, At Off Study.** Alternatively, frequency values from Section 2.A.81.2, "Interval component (RI)," (the Interval component of the TQ Timing/Quantity data type could be used; however, note that as of version 2.5, the TQ data type is retained only for backward compatibility). Time point naming conventions and usage must be specified by implementers. Refer to Table 0595 - Study Scheduled Time Point in Chapter 2C for valid values.
