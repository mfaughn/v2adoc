#### 7.12.1.7 PES-7 Sender Event Description (FT) 01066

Definition: This field contains the summary narrative text description of the event that occurred written by the sender, which may include a description of the nature of the event, how the product was involved, any environmental conditions that may have influenced the event, and patient follow-up or required treatment. Note that laboratory results can be encoded as OBX segments rather then including them in the narrative. By representing clinical information in OBX segments rather than in the narrative, these data become much more useful and flexible.
