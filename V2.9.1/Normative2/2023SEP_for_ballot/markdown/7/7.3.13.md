### 7.3.13 ORA â€“ Observation Report Alert Acknowledgement (Event R41) 

This message enables application level acknowledgements in response to the ORU^R40 alert observation message.

The R41 trigger event is used to indicate that the alert observation has been delivered to, and acknowledged by, a clinical user. If the clinical user can be identified, that identity can be conveyed in the PRT segment (with PRT-4 value AAP Alert Acknowledging Provider).

Considering that the alerts may be received by multiple providers, multiple acknowledgements may be returned. The behavior associated with the user acknowledgement may be specified in a local implementation agreement or implementation guide and may be indicated in MSH-21 Message Profile Identifier.
