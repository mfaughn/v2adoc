#### 7.12.1.5 PES-5 Sender Event Identifier (EI) 01064

Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)> ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)> ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: The first component of this field contains the product manufacturerâ€™s unique alphanumeric identifier for this specific event. This identifier will be used on all subsequent communications regarding this event. For events reported to the FDA, the identifier is: the FDA assigned manufacturer or distributor number; a hyphen; the 4-digit year; a hyphen; and a consecutive 5-digit sequence number for each report filled by the sender that year. For example, the event identifier for the third event reported in 1996 by a manufacturer whose FDA-assigned registration number is 1234567 would be 1234567-1993-3. Organizations without a FDA-assigned registration number should use 0000000 until assigned a number. Reports from other facilities should use the 10-digit HCFA number left padded with zeros in place of the FDA-assigned registration number. The second through fourth components are defined in exactly the same way as the three components of the hierarchic designator (HD) data type (Section 2.8.18, "HD - hierarchic designator").
