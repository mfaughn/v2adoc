#### 7.4.2.21 OBX-21 Observation Instance Identifier (EI) 02180

Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)> ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)> ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains a unique identifier for this observation. This instance identifier is persistent between messages.

Note: OBX-21 Observation Instance Identifier was introduced in v 2.6 to support Patient Care messaging concepts and constructs. At this time, there are no documented use cases for this field in the context of messages as described in this chapter. This statement does not preclude the use of OBX-21, but implementers should exercise caution in using this field outside of the Patient Care context until the appropriate use cases are established. This identifier provides persistent reference to an object within or outside the message and represents an identifier established by external applications rather than temporal message considerations.
