#### 7.4.2.13 OBX-13 User Defined Access Checks (ST) 00581

Definition: This field permits the producer to record results-dependent codes for classifying the observation at the receiving system. This field should be needed only rarely, because most classifications are fixed attributes of the observation ID and can be defined in the associated observation master file (see description in Chapter 8).

However, there are a few cases when such controls vary with the value of the observation in a complex way that the receiving system would not want to re‑calculate. An example is an antimicrobial susceptibility result. Some systems prefer to display only the susceptibility results of inexpensive antimicrobials depending upon the organism, the source of the specimen and the patient’s allergy status. The sending service wants to send all of the susceptibilities so that certain privileged users (e.g., Infectious Disease specialists) can review all of the results but non-privileged users would see only the "preferred" antimicrobials to which the organism was susceptible. We expect that other cases also occur.
