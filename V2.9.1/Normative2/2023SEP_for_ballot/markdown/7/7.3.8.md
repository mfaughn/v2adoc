### 7.3.8 OUL – Unsolicited Specimen Oriented Observation Message (Event R22 )

This message was designed to accommodate specimen oriented testing. It should be applicable to container-less testing (e.g., elephant on a table) and laboratory automation systems requiring container.

Generally this construct allows transfer of multiple results related to a specimen from a patient, where this specimen has been in none, one, or multiple containers.

In addition to the patient results themselves it permits the communication of the following kinds of information:

• Analysis results of a non patient related sample (e.g., environmental) – patient related segments (e.g., PID, PD1, PV1, PV2) are optional.

• Analysis results to a particular container with QC sample and the lot and manufacturer information about this sample (SAC-INV segments) – however for this purpose the "Unsolicited Specimen Container Oriented Observation Message" (OUL^R23) is recommended due to explicit relation between the observation and the container.

• Basic identification data (lot, manufacturer, etc.) of the reagents and other substances involved in the generation of analysis results (TCD-SID segments).

Refer to Chapter 13 Laboratory Automation for additional examples of usage of SAC.

The Device segment (DEV) provides additional device information for a device referenced in one or more of the PRT segments in the message (using PRT-10 Participation Device to match DEV-2 Unique Device Identifier or PRT-22 Participation Device Type using DEV-3 Device Type).
