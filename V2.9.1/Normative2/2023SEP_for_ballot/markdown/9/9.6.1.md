### 9.6.1 MDM/ACK - Original Document Notification (Event T01)

This is a notification of the creation of a document without the accompanying content. There are multiple approaches by which systems become aware of documents:

**Scenario A:** A document is dictated and chart tracking system is notified that it has been dictated and is awaiting transcription.

**Scenario B:** Dictation is transcribed and chart tracking system is notified that the document exists and requires authentication.

**Scenario C:** A provider orders a series of three X-rays. The radiologist dictates a single document which covers all three orders. Multiple placer numbers are used to identify each of these orders.
