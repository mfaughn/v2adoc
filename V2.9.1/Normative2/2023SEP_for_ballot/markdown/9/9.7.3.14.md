#### 9.7.3.14 TXA-14 Placer Order Number (EI) 00216

Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)> ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)> ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field is the placer applicationâ€™s order number.

This is a composite field. The first component is a string of characters that identifies an individual order (i.e., OBR). It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the (filler) assigning authority of the placing application. The (filler) assigning authority is a string of characters that will be uniquely associated with an application. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique entity identifiers. The components are separated by component delimiters.

TXA-14 - Condition: If corresponding ORC and/or OBR segments are present in the message and ORC-2 or OBR-2 is valued, this field must be blank. If TXA-14 is valued while ORC-2 or OBR-2 is valued it shall be ignored. See message definitions including TXA for further guidance on which ORC/OBR pairs to consider.
