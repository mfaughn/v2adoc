#### 9.7.3.19 TXA-19 Document Availability Status (ID) 00930

Definition: This is an optional field which identifies a document’s availability for use in patient care. If an organization’s business rules allow a document to be used for patient care before it is authenticated, the value of this field should be set to "AV." If a document has been made available for patient care, it cannot be changed or deleted. If an erroneous document has been made available at any point in time and a replacement is not appropriate, then it may be marked as "Canceled" and removed, as in the case of a document being assigned to the wrong patient. Additional information must be provided via an addendum, which is separately authenticated and date/time stamped. If the content of a document whose status is "Available" must be revised, this is done by issuing a replacement, which is separately authenticated and date/time stamped. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70273[_HL7 Table 0273 - Document Availability Status_] for valid values.
