#### 2A.2.67.9 Event Offset Quantity (NM)

Definition: An interval that marks the offsets for the beginning, width and end of the event-related periodic interval measured from the time each such event actually occurred. A positive numeric value indicates the amount of time after the event in RPT.8. A negative numeric value indicates the amount of time prior to the event in _RPT.8_. _RPT.10 - Event Offset Units_ defines the units of time for this component.

**Usage Note:** This component should not be valued unless there is a value in RPT-8 (Event).
