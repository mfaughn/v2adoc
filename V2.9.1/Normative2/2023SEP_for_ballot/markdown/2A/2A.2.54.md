Definition: This data type is used to specify a patient location within a healthcare institution. Which components are valued depends on the needs of the site. For example for a patient treated at home, only the person location type is valued. It is most commonly used for specifying patient locations, but may refer to other types of locations within a healthcare setting.

**Note:** This data type contains several location identifiers that should be thought of in the following order from the most general to the most specific: facility, building, floor, point of care, room, bed.\
Additional data about any location defined by these components can be added in the following components: person location type, location description and location status.
