#### 2A.2.56.16 Name Representation Code (ID)

Definition: Different name/address types and representations of the same name/address should be described by repeating of this field, with different values of the Name/Address Type and/or Name/Address Representation component.

**Note:** This new component remains in “alphabetic” representation with each repetition of the field using these data types. That is, even though the name may be represented in an ideographic character set, this component will remain represented in an alphabetic character set.

In general this component provides an indication of the representation provided by the data item. It does not necessarily specify the character sets used. Thus, even though the representation might provide an indication of what to expect, the sender is still free to encode the contents using whatever character set is desired. This component provides only hints for the receiver, so it can make choices regarding what it has been sent and what it is capable of displaying.
