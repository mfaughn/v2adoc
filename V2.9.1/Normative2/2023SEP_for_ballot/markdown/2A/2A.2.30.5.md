#### 2A.2.30.5 Surname from Partner/Spouse (ST)

Definition: The portion of the person’s surname (in most Western usage, the last name) that is derived from the surname of the person’s partner or spouse, as distinguished from the part derived from the person’s own surname. This component is optional.

If no portion of the person’s surname is derived from the surname of the person’s partner or spouse, this component is not valued. Otherwise, if the surname of the partner or spouse has legally changed to become (or incorporate) the person’s surname, this is the surname of the partner or spouse immediately prior to such change.
