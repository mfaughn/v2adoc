#### 2A.2.89.6 Assigning Authority (HD)

Definition: The assigning authority is a unique identifier of the system (or organization or agency or department) that creates the data. Assigning authorities are unique across a given HL7 implementation. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70363[_User-defined Table 0363 - Assigning_ _Authorit__y_] for suggested values.

**Note:** When the HD data type is used in a given segment as a component of a field of another data type, file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300_ _- Namespace ID_] (referenced by the first sub-component of the HD component) may be re-defined (given a different user-defined table number and name) by the technical committee responsible for that segment.\
\
By site agreement, implementers may continue to use file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70300[_User-defined Table 0300 â€“ N__amespace ID_] for the first sub-component.
