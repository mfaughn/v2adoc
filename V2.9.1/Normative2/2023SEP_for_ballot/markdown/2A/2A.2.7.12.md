#### 2A.2.7.12 Name of Second Alternate Coding System (ID)

Definition: Identifies the coding scheme being used in the Second Alternate Identifier component. Analogous to _CF. Name of Coding System_.

This component is required when _CF.10_ is populated and _CF.20_ is not populated. Both _CF.10_ and _CF.20_ may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the coding ystem as specified in _CF.12_ and/or _CF.20_ the Coding System component or the Coding System OID for the tuple.
