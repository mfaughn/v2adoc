Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70335[_User-de__fined Table 0335 - Repeat Pattern_] for suggested values.

The first component may repeat, with repeat values separated by a space. The repeats are interpreted as connected by logical ANDs.

Example:

Twice per day, every other day: BID QOD

Three times per day, Monday Wednesday and Friday: TID QJ135

Because of this syntax, repeat values should never contain blanks.
