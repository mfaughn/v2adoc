#### 2A.2.91.6 Area/City Code (SNM)

Definition: The numeric code to access telephone services in another area/city within a country. This number historically needs not be dialed if the caller is located in the same area/city as the phone number of the called party.

The use and size of area/city codes is however country specific: some countries do not use area/city codes, or the use of area/city codes may be mandatory when dialing, or area/city codes may be used to group phone numbers based on other criteria than geographic location, such as cell-phone area/city-codes, or free information numbers (e.g., 800 numbers).

Most countries have a prefix for Area/City codes which only has to be dialed if one doesnâ€™t use a country code. This prefix (mostly "0", sometimes "9") should be omitted from the content of this field. If the prefix for the Area/Code is also mandatory if one uses the country code (e.g., in Italy) then this field should also contain the prefix.
