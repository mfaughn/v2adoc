| 1 |  | 6# | NM | O |  | Channel Calibration Sensitivity Correction Factor |  | 2A.2.47 |
| 2 |  | 6# | NM | O |  | Channel Calibration Baseline |  | 2A.2.47 |
| 3 |  | 6# | NM | O |  | Channel Calibration Time Skew |  | 2A.2.47 |

Definition: This data type identifies the corrections to channel sensitivity, the baseline, and the channel time skew when transmitting waveform results.

**Note:** Replaces the CM data type used in 7.14.1.5 OBX-5.3 where OBX-5 Observation value (*) is data type CD as of v 2.5.
