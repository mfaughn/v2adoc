#### 2A.2.30.4 Surname Prefix from Partner/Spouse (ST)

Definition: Internationalization usage for Germanic languages. This component is optional. An example of a &lt;surname prefix> is the “van” in "Ludwig van Beethoven". Since the &lt;surname prefix> doesn’t sort completely alphabetically, it is reasonable to specify it as a separate sub-component of the PN and extended PN data types (XPN and XCN).

**Note:** Subcomponents &lt;own surname prefix>, &lt;own surname>, &lt;surname prefix from partner/spouse> and &lt;surname from partner/spouse> decompose complex Germanic names such as “Martha de Mum-van Beethoven”. If these subcomponents are valued, the &lt;surname> subcomponent should still be fully valued for backward compatibility, i.e., ^de Mum-van Beethoven&de&Mum&van&Beethoven^.”\
Also, for clarity, the &lt;last name prefix> has been renamed to &lt;own surname prefix>.
