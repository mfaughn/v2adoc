#### 2A.2.13.3 Name of Coding System (ID)

Definition: The third component contains the code for the name of the coding system from which the value in _CWE.1_ is obtained. Each coding system is assigned a unique identifier. As of v2.7 this component is required when _CWE.1_ is populated and _CWE.14_ is not populated. Both _CWE.3_ and _CWE.14_ may be populated. Receivers should not identify a code based on its position within the tuples (Identifier, Alternate Identifier, or Second Alternate Identifier) or position within a repeating field. Instead, the receiver should always examine the codingSystem as specified in _CWE.3_ and/or _CWE.14_, the "Coding System" component or the "Coding System OID" for the tuple.
