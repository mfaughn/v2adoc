#### 2A.2.63.4 Gestational Age Range (NR)

Definition: This component specifies the gestational age range for which the reference range is valid. Gestational age is relevant only when the reference range is influenced by the stage of pregnancy. The gestational age is measured in weeks from conception. For example, |1&4| implies that the normals apply to gestational ages from 1 week to 4 weeks inclusive. The lower end of the range is not included; the upper end is, assuring that series of age ranges do not overlap.
