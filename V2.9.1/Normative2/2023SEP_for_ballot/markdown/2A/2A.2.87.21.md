#### 2A.2.87.21 Preference Order (NM)

Definition: For an entity having multiple addresses, indicates which is the 'most preferred' (lowest number) to 'least preferred' (highest number).

If the preference order is unique across all usages for a given type, then it indicates the preference across all usages, (e.g., first try my home address, then my business address). Otherwise, the preference order is assumed to only apply within a specific usage.

Preference order numbers need not be sequential (i.e., four addresses with the priority orders of 10, 1, 5 and 15 are legitimate). The preference order numbers must be non-negative.
