#### 2A.2.91.7 Local Number (SNM)

Definition: The numeric code used to contact the called party, exclusive of country and area/city codes. The Local Number is required when, and allowed only if, _XTN.4_ and _XTN.12_ are not populated.

The size of the Local Number is country specific.

**Note**: The Local Number does not include the numeric codes that have to be dialed once a connection has been established. Examples include (automated) organizational phone systems which allow external callers to dial additional numeric codes. These additional numeric codes should be specified as an extension.
