### 1.8.8 Central, Unified Hardware and Software Controls for Security and Trusted Continuous Protection

HL7 Version 2.x standards do not attempt to support hardware and software security controls, nor does it provide means to insure continuous protection of data from unauthorized changes. Such a feature may be useful in limiting access to certain types of data to devices and/or users, based on device type or location. Certain U.S. DOD requirements and IOM recommendations may require users to implement these on their own and/or rely on specific applications vendors to support this requirement.
