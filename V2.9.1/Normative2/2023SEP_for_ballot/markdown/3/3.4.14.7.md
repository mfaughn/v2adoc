Definition: This field defines the security classification (as defined by ISO/IEC 2382-8:1998(E/F)/ T-REC-X.812-1995) of an IT resource, in this case the message, which may be used to make access control decisions. Use of this field supports the business requirement for increasing or decreasing the level of confidentiality (classification or declassification) for a given message.

> Refer to Externally-defined HL7 Table 0952 – HL7 Confidentiality Classification. Use of this table is recommended. The codes in this table are comprehensive non-overlapping hierarchical codes: Very Restricted > Restricted > Normal > Moderate > Low > Unrestricted. Restrictions to a comprehensive, non-overlapping set of codes is required for purposes of access control system algorithms such as Bell–LaPadula Mode, which is used to adjudicate access requests against privacy policies. See Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.
