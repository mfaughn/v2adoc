Definition: This field specifies the information to which access to sensitive information is restricted by applicable jurisdictional, organizational, patient privacy policy or law. This field is used to identify overarching context, for example specific policy defined data elements or message groups when applicable to ALL groups in the message. For example, under a specific minor’s right to consent for healthcare law coded in ARV-3, all of the minor’s demographic data coded in ARV-4 is sensitive, which may be conveyed in several segments (PID, PD1, PD2)). To a specific element, access may be restricted at the field level by employing the specific HL7 field location in ARV-9. For example, when only some of the demographic data is considered sensitive under a particular minor’s consent coded in ARV-3. Refer to file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70717[_User-defined Table 0717 – Access Restriction Value_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values.

The intent of this table is to declare the applicable patient consent directive, organizational policy or jurisdicitonal law.

As examples in the US this could be HIPAA Authorizations for Disclosure, HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practice or 42 CFR Part 2.
