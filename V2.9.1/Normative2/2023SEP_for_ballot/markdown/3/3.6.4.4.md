#### *3.6.4.4* Client system assigns identifier, person exists on MPI only

In this scenario, a client system (e.g., a registration system) will query an MPI for a person that does not currently exist on the client system. The MPI returns a list of one or more possible matching candidates, and one is chosen by the user on the client system. The client system assigns the person an identifier and an update is sent to the MPI to notify it of the new assigned identifier.
