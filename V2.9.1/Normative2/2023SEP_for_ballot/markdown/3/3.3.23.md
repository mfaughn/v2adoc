### 3.3.23 ADT/ACK - Delete a Patient Record (Event A23)

The A23 event is used to delete visit or episode-specific information from the patient record. For example, it is used to remove old data from a database that cannot hold all historical patient visit data. When an event was entered erroneously, use one of the cancel transactions. This event can be used to purge account-level data while retaining the person in the database.
