#### *3.4.14.9* ARV-9 Access Restriction Message Location (ERL) 03514

Components: &lt;Segment ID (ST)> ^ &lt;Segment Sequence (NM)> ^ &lt;Field Position (NM)> ^ &lt;Field Repetition (NM)> ^ &lt;Component Number (NM)> ^ &lt;Sub-Component Number (NM)>

Definition: This field is optional and repeating and identifies the location in a message related to the identified access restricted data. If multiple repetitions are present, the listed access restrictions apply to all listed places.

**Note:** Realm, business and policy rules will determine to what level the restrictions need to be supported. For example in a lab result exchange setting identifying elements more granular than the result at the segment level (i.e.OBX) is not expected, while in other settings more granular settings may apply.
