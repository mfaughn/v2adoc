### 3.3.38 ADT/ACK - Cancel Pre-Admit (Event A38)

The A38 event is sent when an A05 (pre-admit a patient) event is cancelled, either because of erroneous entry of the A05 event or because of a decision not to pre-admit the patient after all.

The fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.
