### 3.3.58 QBP/RSP - Get Corresponding Identifiers (QBP) and Response (RSP) (Events Q23 and K23)

This query/response is designed for interaction between a client system and an MPI (Master Person Index). The query consists of an identifier for a person, and the response is a list of identifiers for that person from the domains specified.

| Input Parameter | Comp. Name | DT | Description |
| PersonIdentifier |  | CX | Components: &lt;ID (ST)> ^ &lt;check digit (ST)> ^ &lt;code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)> ^ &lt; assigning authority (HD)> ^ &lt;identifier type code (IS)> ^ &lt; assigning facility (HD) |
|  |  |  | The combination of values for _PersonIdentifier.ID, and PersonIdentifier.AssigningAuthority,_ are intended to identify a person uniquely. The _PersonIdentifier.IDTypeCode_ is useful for further filtering or to supply uniqueness in the event that the assigning authority may have more than one coding system. |
|  |  |  | Example: ...\ |
| 112234^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL\ | ... |  |  |
|  | Only one PID.3 may be specified, only 1 segment pattern will be returned. |  |  |
|  |  | PersonIdentifier | ID |
|  | PID.3.1must be valued. | PersonIdentifier | Assigning Authority |
|  | PID.3.4 must be valued. | PersonIdentifier | Identifier type code |
|  |  | WhatDomainsReturned |  |
| CX | Components: &lt;ID (ST)> ^ &lt;check digit (ST)> ^ &lt;code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)> ^ &lt; assigning authority (HD)> ^ &lt;identifier type code (IS)> ^ &lt; assigning facility (HD) |  |  |
|  | This parameter restricts the set of domains for which identifiers are returned in PID-3. If this is not specified, then identifiers for all known domains shall be returned. It does not restrict the search for the person. |  |  |
|  | Example: \ | ^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL~^^^SOUTH LAB\ |  |
|  |  |  | Only the following components should be valued. |
| WhatDomainsReturned | Assigning Authority |  | PID.3.4 must be valued. |
| WhatDomainsReturned. | Identifier type code |  |  |

Following is an example of a Q23/K23 query/response pair of messages. First is the query:

MSH|^~\&|CLINREG|WESTCLIN|HOSPMPI|HOSP|199912121135-0600||QBP^Q23^QBP_Q21|1|D|2.5

QPD|Q23^Get Corresponding IDs^HL7nnnn|111069|112234^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL|^^^WEST CLINIC~^^^SOUTH LAB|

RCP||I|

This query is asking for identifiers from WEST CLINIC and SOUTH LAB for the person identified with the identifier 112234 from the assigning authority GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL. Here is a sample response:

MSH|^~\&|HOSPMPI|HOSP|CLINREG|WESTCLIN|199912121135-0600||RSP^K23^RSP_K23|1|D|2.5|

MSA|AA|8699|

QAK|111069|OK|Q23^Get Corresponding IDs^HL7nnnn|1|

QPD|Q23^Get Corresponding IDs^HL7nnn|111069|112234^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL|^^^WEST CLINIC~^^^SOUTH LAB|

PID|||56321A^^^WEST CLINIC~66532^^^SOUTH LAB||EVERYMAN^ADAM||19630423|M||C|N2378 South Street^^Madison^WI^53711|

**Note:** that the identifiers returned do not include the GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL identifier, as it was not specified in the list of WhatDomainsReturned.
