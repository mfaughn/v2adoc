##### 3.6.2.1.6 Tightly coupled relationship

When patient/person identifiers are the target in merge, move, or change events, as specified in the _PID-2 - Patient ID_, _PID-3 - Patient Identifier List_ and _PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID-PID_, the associated source identifiers in the _MRG-4 - Prior Patient ID_, _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_, and _MRG-2 - Prior Alternate Patient ID_, respectively, must be "tightly coupled." Each event that is defined as a merge, move, or change message carries the "tightly" coupled relationship at the appropriate level in one of two ways: first, by virtue of positional placement in the sequence of identifiers; or, second, by identifier type and assigning authority. The methodology used to establish the definition of "tightly coupled" relationship is determined by site negotiation. The recommended definition is by virtue of positional placement in the sequence of identifiers (pairwise). In addition, HL7 allows the use of the second definition by identifier type and assigning authority as an acceptable convention to establish a "tightly coupled" relationship. In the absence of a site negotiated definition, it is assumed that the positional placement of the identifiers is the default method.

The list of identifiers can be aligned positionally in their respective segment fields and processed by the receiving system by virtue of their order. This is sometimes referred to as an "ordered pairwise" relationship and is described further in section _3.6.2.1.7_, "[_Ordered pairwise relationship_](#ordered-pairwise-relationship)".

Alternatively, the uniqueness of the identifiers included in the message is determined by the combination of identifier type and assigning authority. It is assumed that both sending system and receiving system can inspect both of these qualifiers as a message is constructed or processed to determine the "tightly coupled" relationship between the identifiers. This can be referred to as "identifier type/assigning authority" relationship and is described further in section _3.6.2.1.8_, "link:#_Identifier_type_/_assigning authori[_Identifier type/assigning authority relationship_]".

The pairing of identifiers between the MRG segment fields and their associated identifiers in the PID or PV1 segment are defined below:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Person** |  |  |
| _PID-2 - Patient ID_ | **_with_** | _MRG-4 - Prior Patient ID_ |
| **Patient** |  |  |
| _Pid-3 - Patient Identifier List_ | **_with_** | _MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List_ |
|  | **_and by_** | Explicit order of identifiers in the list |
|  | **_or by_** | _&lt;identifier type code>_ and _&lt;assigning authority>_ field components |
| _PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID_ | **_with_** | _MRG-2 - Prior Alternate Patient ID_ |
| **Account** |  |  |
| _PID-18 - Patient Account Number_ | **_with_** | _MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number_ |
| **Visit** |  |  |
| _PV1-19 - Visit Number_ | **_with_** | _MRG-5 - Prior Visit Number_ |
| _PV1-50 - Alternate Visit ID_ | **_with_** | _MRG-6 - Prior Alternate Visit ID_ |
