| Input Parameter | Comp. Name | DT | Description |
| PersonIdentifier () |  | CX | Components: &lt;ID (ST)> ^ &lt;check digit (ST)> ^ &lt;code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)> ^ &lt; assigning authority (HD)> ^ &lt;identifier type code (IS)> ^ &lt; assigning facility (HD) |
|  |  |  | The combination of values for _PersonIdentifier.ID, and PersonIdentifier.AssigningAuthority,_ are intended to identify a person uniquely. The _PersonIdentifier.IDTypeCode_ is useful for further filtering or to supply uniqueness in the event that the assigning authority may have more than one coding system. |
|  |  |  | Example: ...\ |
| 112234^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL\ | ... |  |  |
|  | Only one PID.3 may be specified, only 1 segment pattern will be returned. |  |  |
|  |  | PersonIdentifier. | ID |
|  | PID.3.1must be valued. | PersonIdentifier | Assigning Authority |
|  | PID.3.4 must be valued. | PersonIdentifier | Identifier type code |
|  |  | WhatDomainsReturned |  |
| CX | Components: &lt;ID (ST)> ^ &lt;check digit (ST)> ^ &lt;code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)> ^ &lt; assigning authority (HD)> ^ &lt;identifier type code (IS)> ^ &lt; assigning facility (HD) |  |  |
|  | This parameter restricts the set of domains for which identifiers are returned in PID-3. If this is not specified, then identifiers for all known domains shall be returned. It does not restrict the search for the person. |  |  |
|  | Example: ...\ | ^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL~^^^SOUTH LAB\ | ... |
|  |  |  | Only the following components should be valued. |
| WhatDomainsReturned | Assigning Authority |  | PID.3.4 must be valued. |
| WhatDomainsReturned | Identifier type code |  |  |

Following is an example of a Q21/K21 query/response pair of messages. First is the query:

MSH|^~\&|CLINREG|WESTCLIN|HOSPMPI|HOSP|199912121135-0600||QBP^Q21^QBP_Q21|1|D|2.5

QPD|Q21^Get Person Demographics^HL7nnn|111069|112234^^^GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL|^^^ GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL~^^^SOUTH LAB|

RCP|I|

This query is asking for demographics for the person identified by the identifier 112234 from the assigning authority GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL. With the demographics, we want identifiers returned for the person from the assigning authorities GOOD HEALTH HOSPITAL and SOUTH LAB. Here is a sample response:

MSH|^~\&|HOSPMPI|HOSP|CLINREG|WESTCLIN|199912121135-0600||RSP^K21^RSP_K21|1|D|2.5|
