### 16.3.13 RSP^E22 – Authorization Request Status Query Response (event E22) 

This message is used to respond to a QPB^E22 – Query Authorization Request Status. It provides Authorization status information to a Provider.

A QBP^E22 – Query Authorization Request Status can be used to query against a Authorization Request or a specific Product/Service Line Item in a Authorization Request. The same response message, RSP^E22 – Authorization Request Query Response, is used for both types of query.

Processing Rules:

1) Provider Invoice Number + Payer Invoice Number + Product/Service Line Item Number on input message must exist on Payer Application’s database and must point to the same Product/Service Line Item; otherwise, an error must be generated (mismatched Authorization Request and/or Product/Service Line Item).

2) Sending Organization and Sending Application on input message must be the same as the Sending Organization and Sending Application from the original Authorization Request (submitted via the EHC^E20 – Submit Authorization Request message) for the specified Authorization Request being queried.

3) A unique query identifier (Query Tag on QPD) must be generated for each query.
