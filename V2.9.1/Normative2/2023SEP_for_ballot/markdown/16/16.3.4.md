### 16.3.4 RSP^E03 – HealthCare Services Invoice Status Query Response (event E03) 

This message is used to respond to a QPB^E03 – Query HealthCare Services Invoice. It provides Invoice and invoice processing information to a Provider.

A QBP^E03 – Query HealthCare Services Invoice can be used to query against an Invoice or a specific Product/Service Line Item in an Invoice. The same response message, RSP^E03 – HealthCare Services Invoice Query Response, is used for both types of query.

Processing Rules:

1) Provider Invoice Number + Payer Invoice Number + Product/Service Line Item Number on input message must exist on Payer Application’s database and must point to the same Product/Service Line Item, otherwise an error must be generated (mismatched Invoice and/or Product/Service Line Item).

2) Sending Organization and Sending Application on input message must be the same as the Sending Organization and Sending Application from the original Invoice (submitted via the EHC^E01 – Submit HealthCare Services Invoice message) for the specified Invoice being queried.

3) A unique query identifier (Query Tag on QPD) must be generated for each query.
