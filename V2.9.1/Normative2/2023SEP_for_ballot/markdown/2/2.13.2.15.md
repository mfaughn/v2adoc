Definition: This field defines the security classification (as defined by ISO/IEC 2382-8:1998(E/F)/ T-REC-X.812-1995) of an IT resource, in this case the message, which might be used to make access control decisions. It is conditionally required when MSH-27 or MSH-28 are used.

Conditionality Predicate: Required if BHS-16 or BHS-17 or any contained FSH-16 or FSH-17 or MSH-26 or MSH-27 is valued, Optional if neither BHS-16 nor BHS-17 , nor any contained FSH-16 or FSH-17, nor MSH-26 nor MSH-27is valued."

Use of this field supports the business requirement for declaring the level of confidentiality (classification) for a given message.

Refer to Externally-defined HL7 Table 0952 – HL7 Confidentiality Code in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. Use of this table is recommended. The codes in this table are comprehensive, non-overlapping hierarchical codes: Very Restricted > Restricted > Normal > Moderate > Low > Unrestricted. Restrictions to a comprehensive, non-overlapping set of codes is required for purposes of access control system algorithms such as Bell–LaPadula Mode, which isl used to adjudicate access requests against privacy policies.
