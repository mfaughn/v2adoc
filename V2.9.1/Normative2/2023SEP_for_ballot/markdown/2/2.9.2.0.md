#### 2.9.2.0 Segment fragmentation/continuation using the ADD segment

Beginning with version 2.4, the ADD segment can be used within a message to break a long segment into shorter segments within a single HL7 message.

**Note:** Unless some explicit agreement exists between systems, a receiving application SHOULD NOT infer semantic meaning from the placement of the ADD segment.

To break a large segment,

a) the segment being continued (call it ANY for this example) is ended at an arbitrary character position and terminated with the standard segment terminator (carriage return).

b) the following segment is the ADD segment. All characters after the ADD and field separator ("|") are logically part of the preceding segment. All succeeding consecutive ADD segments contribute characters to the ANY segment until a non ADD segment is found.

c) an ADD segment with no field separator takes on special meaning. See Section [_2.10.2.3_](#segment-fragmentation-across-messages), "[_Segment fragmentation across messages_](#segment-fragmentation-across-messages)".

For example, segment "C" can be fragmented within an HL7 message as follows:

A|1

B|2

C|34

ADD|5|678|

ADD|90

D|1

This is logically the same as

A|1

B|2

C|345|678|90

D|1
