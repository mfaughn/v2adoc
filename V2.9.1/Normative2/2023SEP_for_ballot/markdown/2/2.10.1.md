Messages MAY be locally extended as follows:

a) Users MAY develop local Z messages to cover areas not already covered by existing HL7 messages. These SHOULD be composed of HL7 segments where possible.

b) A local Z message MAY consist entirely of Z segments except that it SHALL begin with a MSH segment.

c) A local Z Acknowledgment message SHALL begin with an MSH segment followed by an MSA segment, an optional SFT segment and a conditional ERR segment.

d) Users MAY develop Z segments and add them to Z messages.

e) Users MAY develop Z segments and add them to HL7 messages. The trigger event MAY remain the same if the intent of the message has remained unchanged.

f) The practice of adding additional HL7 segments, like NTE, to existing HL7 messages locally is ill-advised. HL7 MAY move or change the segment in a future release; this will render the message unparsible.
