#### 2.4.3.1 Field or Component Status

> HL7 does not care how systems actually store data within an application. When fields are transmitted, they are sent as character strings
>
> A field SHALL exist in one of three population states in an HL7 message:
>
> **Populated**. (Synonyms: valued, non-blank, not blank, not empty.) The sending system sends a value in the field. For example, if a sending system includes medical record number, that would be communicated as |1234567^^^MR^KP-CA|.

**Note:** that the field might be populated with a code that means "no information" or "unknown".

> **Not populated**. (Synonyms: unpopulated, not valued, unvalued, blank, empty, not present, missing.) The sending system does not supply a value for the field. The Sender might or might not have a value for the field. The receiving system can make no inference regarding the absence of an element value if there is not a conformance profile governing the implementation. However, if there is a Conformance Message Profile in effect, then special rules apply; see section 2.B, "Conformance Using Message Profiles".
>
> **Null. HL7 v2.x does not have an explicit concept for null values.**
>
> **Populated with Delete Indicator:** Any existing value for the corresponding data base element in the receiving application SHOULD be deleted. This is symbolically communicated as two double-quotes between the delimiters (i.e., |""|).Employing consecutive double quote characters as the only content of a field for other purposes is prohibited.
>
> Refer to Chapter [_2.5_](#_Message_construction_rules), "[_Message construction rules_](#_Message_construction_rules)" for information on data fields with a delete indicator.
>
> The various chapters of the Standard contain segment attribute tables. These tables list and describe the data fields in the segment and characteristics of their usage. In defining a segment, the following information is specified about each field:
>
> 1. SEQ : Position
>
> 2. LEN : Normative Length
>
> 3. C.LEN : Conformance Length
>
> 4. DT : Data Type
>
> 5. OPT: Optionality
>
> 6. RP/# : Repitition
>
> 7. TBL# : Table Identifier
>
> 8. ITEM# : ID Number
>
> 9. Element Name
>
> Chapter 2A contains similar tables that describe the components of a data type. In defining a data type, the following information is specified about each component:
>
> 1. SEQ : Position
>
> 2. LEN : Normative Length
>
> 3. C.LEN : Conformance Length
>
> 4. DT : Data Type
>
> 5. OPT: Optionality
>
> 6. TBL# : Table Identifier
>
> 7. Component Name
>
> 8. Comments
>
> 9. SEC.REF: The reference to where the data type is defined
>
> The following sections describe the information that is provided in the table.
