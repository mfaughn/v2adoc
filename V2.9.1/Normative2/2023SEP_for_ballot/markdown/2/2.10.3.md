### 2.10.3 Segment groups

a) The practice of turning a single segment or segments into a segment group locally **SHALL NOT be** allowed within an HL7 event. It will have a negative impact on XML and any component-based encoding schemes. Note that HL7, on other hand, can do this.

b) A segment group MAY NOT be ungrouped locally.

For example, if there is an HL7 group as follows:

\{

ABC

[DEF

[GHI]]

}

one cannot change it in a local implementation to be as follows:

\{[ABC]}

[DEF]

[GHI]

Example 2:

If the original definition was:

GROUP1 ::= ABC, GROUP2?

GROUP2 ::= DEF, GHI?

and someone wished to constrain the segments in GROUP2 to be mandatory

(i.e., the HL7 grammar would look like:

\{[

ABC

DEF

[GHI]

]}

Their message instance would need to still look like:

&lt;GROUP1>

&lt;ABC/>

&lt;GROUP2>

&lt;DEF/>

&lt;GHI/>

&lt;/GROUP2>

&lt;/GROUP1>

It would be an error if they instead sent it as:

&lt;GROUP1>

&lt;ABC/>

&lt;DEF/>

&lt;GHI/>

&lt;/GROUP1>

c) A segment group MAY repeat locally. The 1^st^ repetition needs to mean what it does in HL7

d) The practice of incorporating a Z segment into a segment group locally **is** allowed.
