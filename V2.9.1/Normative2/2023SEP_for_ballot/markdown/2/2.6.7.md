### 2.6.7 Usage and Examples of Formatted Text 

> If the field is of the formatted text (FT) data type, formatting commands also SHALL be surrounded by the escape character. Each command begins with the "." (period) character. The following formatting commands are available:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \.sp &lt;number>\ | End current output line and skip &lt;number> vertical spaces. &lt;number> is a positive integer or absent. If &lt;number> is absent, skip one space. The horizontal character position remains unchanged. Note that only for purposes of compatibility with previous versions of HL7, "^\.sp\" is equivalent to "\.br\." |
| \.br\ | Begin new output line. Set the horizontal position to the current left margin and increment the vertical position by 1. |
| \.fi\ | Begin word wrap or fill mode. This is the default state. It can be changed to a no-wrap mode using the .nf command. |
| \.nf\ | Begin no-wrap mode. |
| \.in &lt;number>\ | Indent &lt;number> of spaces, where &lt;number> is a positive or negative integer. This command cannot appear after the first printable character of a line. |
| \.ti &lt;number>\ | Temporarily indent &lt;number> of spaces where number is a positive or negative integer. This command cannot appear after the first printable character of a line. |
| \.sk &lt; number>\ | Skip &lt;number> spaces to the right. |
| \.ce\ | End current output line and center the next line. |

> The component separator that marks each line defines the extent of the temporary indent command (.ti), and the beginning of each line in the no-wrap mode (.nf). Examples of formatting instructions that are NOT included in this data type include: width of display, position on page or screen, and type of output devices.
