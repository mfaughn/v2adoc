Software Certified Version or Release Number helps to provide a complete picture of the application that is sending/receiving HL7 messages. Versions are important in identifying a specific 'release' of an application. In some situations, the receiving application validates the Software Certified Version or Release Number against a list of "certified" versions/releases of the particular software to determine if the sending application adheres to specific business rules required by the receiving application.

Alternatively, the software MAY perform different processing depending on the version of the sending software
