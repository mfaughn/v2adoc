#### 2.4.3.6 Optionality

> Definition: Whether the field is required, optional, or conditional in a segment.
>
> In the segment attribute tables this information is provided in the column labeled **OPT**.
>
> The designations for optionality are:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R | - | required |
| RE | - | Required but MAY be Empty: The field or data type component description SHALL stipulate when the field or data type component MAY be empty. |
| O | - | optional |
| C(a/b) | - | conditional on the trigger event or on some other field(s). The field definitions following the segment attribute table SHOULD specify the algorithm that defines the conditionality for this field. An element with a conditional usage code has an associated condition predicate (See section 2.B.79.9 “Condition Predicate” that determines the requirements (usage code) of the element. If the condition predicate associated with the element is true, follow the rules for **_a_** which SHALL be one of “R”, “RE”, “O” or X”: If the condition predicate associated with the element is false, follow the rules for **_b_** which SHALL be one of “R”, “RE”, “O” or X”. **_a_** and **_b_** can be valued the same. |
| X | - | not used with this trigger event |
| B | - | left in for backward compatibility with previous versions of HL7. The field definitions following the segment attribute table SHOULD denote the optionality of the field for prior versions. |
| W | - | Withdrawn |

> **Note:** For Versions 2.3 and higher: the optionality of fields SHOULD be explicitly documented in the segment field definitions that follow each segment definition table; if the optionality of fields within a segment changes depending on the trigger event, that optionality SHOULD also be explicitly documented.
>
> **Note:** Conditionality defined in Chapter 2 is further expanded by the requirements stated in Chapter 2B. See Chapter 2.B for the explanation of the c(a/b) approach.
>
> For version 2.5 and higher, the optionality, table references, and lengths of data type components are supplied in component tables of the data type definition. The component definitions that follow the component table will elaborate on the optionality and table references. Where needed, additional detailed field definitions will follow the formal segment attribute tables. (See also Sections 2.14, ”Message delimiters”, 2.14,”Data types “ ).
