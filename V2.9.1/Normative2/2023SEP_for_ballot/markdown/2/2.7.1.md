### 2.7.1 Adding messages or message constituents

> When a new message or a new constituent of an HL7 message is introduced it SHALL be defined as described below. A sending system SHOULD be able to send a new message or new constituent; the receiver, regardless of its version level, SHALL ignore any message or message constituent it is not expecting without generating an application failure. This does not preclude a receiver notifying the sender that additional element was ignored, but the receiving application SHOULD NOT fail just from the existence of additional element.

a) New messages MAY be introduced.

b) A new segment group MAY be defined.

c) As of V2.5 the first segment in a newly-defined segment group SHALL be marked as required.

d) New segments MAY be introduced to an existing message. In general these SHOULD be introduced at the end of a message or a segment group, but they MAY be introduced elsewhere within the message if the segment hierarchy makes this necessary. Unless needed as a technical correction or for regulatory reporting purposes, a new segment SHALL NOT be added to a deprecated message. As of v2.6 all new segments, except for those pertaining only to message transmission or control, SHALL include an Action Code field as the first or second field as appropriate.

e) Care must be taken when introducing a new segment if this results in a situation in which a named segment X appears in two individual or group locations. See section _2.5_, "_Message construction rules_".

f) New fields MAY be added at the end of a segment. A field that changes the semantic meaning of a segment (e.g., an Acton Code, or Mood code) SHALL only be introduced in a pre-existing segment if the usage of the field is conditional on it not being used in messages with pre-existing trigger events. This is to avoid the risk of reversing the intent of the segment as it is known to the recipient of an earlier version. For example, if the Sender were to send the segment with a delete action code, the recipient would not understand that the information SHOULD be deleted.

g) A new data type MAY be introduced.

h) New components MAY be added at the end of a data type.

i) A new table MAY be introduced.
