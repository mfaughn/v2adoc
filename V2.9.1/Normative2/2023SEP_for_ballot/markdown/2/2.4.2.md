### 2.4.2 Segments and segment groups

> A **segment** is a logical grouping of data fields. Segments of a message MAY be required or optional. They MAY occur only once in a message or they MAY be allowed to repeat. Each segment is given a name. For example, the ADT message MAY contain the following segments: Message Header (MSH), Event Type (EVN), Patient ID (PID), and Patient Visit (PV1).
>
> Each segment is identified by a unique three-character code known as the Segment ID. Although the actual segments are defined in various chapters, the ID codes assigned to the various segments are listed in Appendix A.
>
> All segment ID codes beginning with the letter **Z** are reserved for locally defined segments. Z Codes SHALL NOT be defined within the HL7 Standard.
>
> Two or more segments MAY be organized as a logical unit called a segment group. A segment group MAY be required or optional and might or might not repeat. As of v 2.5, the first segment in a newly defined segment group will be required to help ensure that unparsable messages will not be inadvertently defined. This required first segment is known as the anchor segment.
>
> A segment group is assigned a name that represents a permanent identifier that SHALLNOT be changed.
>
> A named segment X MAY occur more than once in an abstract message syntax. This differs from repetition described earlier in this section. When this occurs, the following rules SHALL be adhered to:
>
> If, within an abstract message syntax, a named segment X appears in two individual or group locations, and

a) Either appearance is optional or repeating in an individual location or,

b) either appearance is optional or repeating in a group location

> then, the occurrences of segment X SHALL be separated by at least one required segment of a different name so that no ambiguity can exist as to the individual or group location of any occurrence of segment X in a message instance.

> Examples of proper segment grouping

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 |
| \{ SEG 1} | [ SEG1 ] | SEG1 |
| SEG2 | \{ | [ SEG2 ] |
| [ SEG1 ] | SEG2 | SEG3 |
|  | [ SEG1 ] | \{ SEG1 } |
|  | } |  |

> Examples of unparsable segment grouping

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 | Example 4 |
| \{ SEG 1} | \{ SEG1 } | [ SEG1 ] | \{ SEG1 } |
| [ SEG1 ] | [ SEG2 ] | \{ | [ SEG2 |
|  | SEG1 | [ SEG2 ] | SEG3 ] |
|  |  | SEG1 | SEG1 |
|  |  | SEG3 |  |
|  |  | } |  |

> In each of these examples it is not possible to tell which part of the message SEG1 belongs.
