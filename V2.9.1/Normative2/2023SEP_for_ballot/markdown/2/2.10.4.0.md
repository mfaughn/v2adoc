#### 2.10.4.0 Local extension rules for segments

Users SHALL NOT modify an existing segment, except as specified in section _2.7.2_, "_Changing messages or message constituents_".

Locally defined fields MAY be defined for use in locally defined segments, although HL7 defined fields are a better choice when available. The practice of extending an HL7 segment with locally defined fields, while not prohibited, is ill-advised.

HL7 also recognizes that sites MAY have locally defined fields where the users believe the enhancement might be of interest to the HL7 community as a whole and are moving forward with a proposal to HL7.
