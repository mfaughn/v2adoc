#### 2.9.3.4 Batch message as a query response

**Note:** The QRD and QRF segments were retained for backward compatibility only as of v 2.4. The reader is referred to chapter 5, section 5.4, for the current query/response message structure.

The HL7 query also can be used to query for a batch in the following manner:

a) use the B in ResponseModality field of the RCP segment. The query will be acknowledged with a general acknowledgment as in the Deferred Access example above (see chapter 5)

b) in addition, insert into the batch file the QRD and QRF segments as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| [FHS] | (file header segment) |
| \{ [BHS] | (batch header segment) |
| [QPD] | (the QRD and QRF define the |
| [RCP] | query that this batch is a response to) |
| \{ MSH | (one or more HL7 messages) |
| .... |  |
| .... |  |
| .... |  |
| } |  |
| [BTS] | (batch trailer segment) |
| } |  |
| [FTS] | (file trailer segment) |

c) the acknowledgment of a batch is described in this chapter (see Section _2.9.3.3_, "_Acknowledging batches_").
