#### 2.4.3.7 Repetition

> Definition: Whether the field MAY repeat. The value that appears in the repetitions column is the maximum number of allowed occurrences, e.g., a value of '3' would mean that the field can have '3 occurrences'; if unspecified, there is only one occurrence, i.e., cannot repeat.
>
> In the segment attribute tables this information is provided in the column labeled **RP/#.** Note that components and subcomponents MAY NOT repeat, so this does not apply to components and subcomponents.
>
> The designations for Repetition are:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N or blank | - | no repetition |
| Y | - | the field MAY repeat an indefinite or site-determined number of times |
| (integer) | - | the field MAY repeat up to the number of times specified by the integer |

> Each occurrence MAY contain the number of characters specified by the fieldâ€™s maximum length. See Section _2_.
>
> Usage Note: For improved readability some work groups opt to leave the Repetition fields blank to indicate that the field SHALL NOT repeat. A blank SHALL NOT be construed to mean that the field MAY optionally repeat.
>
> As of v2.5 the Repetition column is to be left blank if the field SHALL NOT repeat.
