### 2.10.5 Data types

The following rules apply for locally extending data types:

a) Locally defined data types MAY be defined for use in locally defined segment fields, although HL7 defined data types are a better choice when available.

b) Locally redefining existing data type components, e.g., changing a component from NM to ST, is prohibited.

c) Data types MAY be locally extended by adding new components at the end. This action creates a Z data type.

**Note**: The practice of extending an HL7 data type with locally defined components is particularly ill-advised and might cause conformance problems with the next release of the HL7 standard.
