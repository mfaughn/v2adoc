### 2.8.3 Response using enhanced acknowledgment

a) the responding system receives the message and commits it to safe storage. This means that the responding system accepts the responsibility for the message in a manner that releases the sending system from any obligation to resend the message. The responding system now checks the message header record to determine whether or not the initiating system requires an accept acknowledgment message indicating successful receipt and secure storage of the message. If it does, the accept acknowledgment message is constructed and returned to the initiator.

b) at this point, the requirements of the applications involved in the interface determine whether or not more information needs to be exchanged. This exchange is referred to as an application acknowledgment and includes information ranging from simple validation to a complex application-dependent response. If the receiving system is expected to return application-dependent information, it initiates another exchange when this information is available. This time, the roles of initiator and responder are reversed.
