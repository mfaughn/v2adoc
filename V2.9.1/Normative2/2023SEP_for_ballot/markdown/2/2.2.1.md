### 2.2.1 Assumptions

> The HL7 Standard makes no assumptions about the ownership of data. It also makes no requirements of its own on the subsequent action of the recipient of data, nor does it make any assumption about the design or architecture of the receiving application system. The scope of HL7 is restricted to the specification of messages between application systems, and the events triggering them. HL7 does not explicitly support, but can be used with, systems that support store and forward and data broadcast facilities (see the HL7 Implementation Support Guide).
