#### 2.13.5.6 ERR-6 Application Error Parameter (ST) 01816

Definition: Additional information to be used, together with the Application Error Code, to understand a particular error condition/warning/etc. This field can repeat to allow for up to 10 parameters.

Example: If the application error code specified in ERR.5 corresponded with the English message "The patient has a remaining deductible of \{0, number, currency} for the period ending \{1, date, medium}.", and the first two repetitions of ERR.6 were "250" and "20021231", then a receiving application in the U.S. would display the message as "The patient has a remaining deductible of $250.00 for the period ending Dec 31, 2002."
