Definition: Business organization that originated and is accountable for the content of the message.

Currently, MSH provides fields to transmit both sending/receiving applications and facilities (MSH.3 â€“ MSH.6). However, these levels of organization do not necessarily relate to or imply a legal entity such as a business organization. As such, multiple legal entities (organizations) mightshare a service bureau, with the same application and facility identifiers. Another level of detail is required to delineate the various organizations using the same service bureau.

Therefore, the Sending Responsible Organization field provides a complete picture from the application level to the overall business level. The Business Organization represents the legal entity responsible for the contents of the message.

Use Case #1: A centralized system responsible for recording and monitoring instances of communicable diseases enforces a stringent authentication protocol with external applications that have been certified to access its information base. In order to allow message exchange, the centralized system mandates that external applications must provide the identity of the business organization sending the message (**Sending Responsible Organization**), the organization it is sending the message to (**Receiving Responsible Organization**, in this case the "owner" of the communicable diseases system), the network address from which the message has originated (**Sending Network Address**), the network address the message is being transmitted to (**Receiving Network Address**). The organization responsible for protecting the information stored within the communicable disease system requires this authentication due to the sensitive nature of the information it contains.
