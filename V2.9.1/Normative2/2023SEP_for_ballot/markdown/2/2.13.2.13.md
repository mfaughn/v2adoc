#### 2.13.2.13 BHS-13 Batch Sending Network Address (HD) 02271

Components: &lt;Namespace ID (IS)> ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)> ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: Identifier of the network location the message was transmitted from. Identified by an OID or text string (e.g., URI). The reader is referred to the "Report from the Joint W3C/IETF URI Planning Interest Group: Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), URLs, and Uniform Resource Names (URNs): Clarifications and Recommendations".footnote:[The URI is: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3305.txt. Note: All IETF documents are available online, and RFCs are available through URIs using this format.]

As with the Sending/Receiving Responsible Organization, the Sending Network Address provides a more detailed picture of the source of the message. This information is lower than the application layer, but is often useful/necessary for routing and identification purposes. This field SHALL only be populated when the underlying communication protocol does not support identification of sending network locations.

The specific values and usage must be site negotiated
