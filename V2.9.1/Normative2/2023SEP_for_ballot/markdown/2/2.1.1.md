|     |     |     |

| To convey the Sense of: | Use the following (in UPPERCASE) |  |
| Required/Mandatory | SHALL* | SHALL NOT* |
| Best Practice/Recommendation | SHOULD* | SHOULD NOT* |
| Acceptable Permitted | MAY* | NEED NOT* |
| *Usage of any of these in lower case does not carry the same weight. |  |  |
