### 2.6.4 Highlighting

> In designating highlighting, the sending application is indicating that the characters that follow somehow can be made to stand out, but leaving the method of doing so to the receiving application. Depending on device characteristics and application style considerations, the receiving application MAY choose reverse video, boldface, underlining, blink, an alternate color or another means of highlighting the displayed data. For example the message fragment:
>
> DSP| TOTAL CHOLESTEROL \H\240*\N\ [90 - 200]
>
> might cause the following data to appear on a screen or report:
>
> TOTAL CHOLESTEROL 240* [90 - 200]
>
> whereas another system might choose to show the 240* in red.
