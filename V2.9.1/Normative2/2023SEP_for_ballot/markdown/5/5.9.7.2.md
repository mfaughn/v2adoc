#### 5.9.7.2 MPI Query Profile – Non query by example version

Query Profile

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Query Statement ID (Query ID=Z75): | Z75 |
| Type: | Query |
| Query Name: | Tabular Patient List |
| Query Trigger (= MSH-9): | QBP^Z75^QBP_Q13 |
| Query Mode: | Both |
| Response Trigger (= MSH-9): | RTB^Z76^RTB_K13 |
| Query Characteristics: | Patient identifier and matching algorithm requirements are passed via the input parameters. Output columns are chosen from a Virtual Table. |
| Purpose: | To find patient records that closely (as specified by the Client) match a set of input criteria using a specified algorithm. |
| Response Characteristics: | Response returns requested columns from the Virtual Table. If no columns were requested, all columns are returned. |
| Based on Segment Pattern: |  |

The message structure for QBP^Z75^QPB_Q13 can be found in 5.3.1.2. Use the QBP^Q13^QPB_Q13 Message structure.
