### 5.7.2 Details

Subscription is a process/protocol that allows one system to request that prospective data be sent for a specified period of time, or for an open-ended period of time until further notice. It allows a message stream to be selectively filtered by a query-like mechanism. Specific messages have been defined for subscription and the canceling of a subscription.

A Publisher is one who possesses and transmits streams of data. The Publisher might be a mediator or a broker, such as an interface engine. The Publisher is not necessarily the system that collected the data, but it is the system willing to transmit it

With traditional "unsolicited update subscriptions" a Publisher sends the entire data stream to the recipients. A Publisher normally transmits unfiltered data. However, the Publisher may agree to selectively filter the stream of data within parameters as defined by analysts. For each filterable stream, the Publisher defines a Query Profile that lists the data values that may be used in the filter expression, and defines the segment pattern for the messages that are selected.

If supported in the Query Profile, a subscription may be modified at a later date. _RCP-6-Modify indicator_ is set to "M", and the Action Code parameter is set to "A" or "D" as appropriate. If modification is allowed, the Server bears responsibility for maintaining the filter list. If, as is usually the case, the onus of retaining the filters is on the Client, modification is not allowed and would not be part of the Query Profile.
