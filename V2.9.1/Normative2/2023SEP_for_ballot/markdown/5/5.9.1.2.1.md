##### 5.9.1.2.1 Comprehensive pharmacy information Query Profile

The following is a highly experimental approach to establishing a super segment pattern response to a general purpose query structure. It contains all of the pharmacy information segments as possible inclusions in the response. It differs from previously defined segment pattern queries in that it cuts across multiple related standard HL7 messages although there is a logical hierarchy that can be determined.

Query Profile

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Query Statement ID (Query ID=Z85): | Z85 |
| Type: | Query |
| Query Name: | Pharmacy Information Comprehensive |
| Query Trigger (= MSH-9): | QBP^Z85^QBP_Q11 |
| Query Mode: | Both |
| Response Trigger (= MSH-9): | RSP^Z86^RSP_Z86 |
| Query Characteristics: | May specify patient, medication, a date range, how the response is to be sorted, and what segment groups are to be returned. |
| Purpose: | To retrieve patient pharmacy history information from the Server. |
| Response Characteristics: | Sorted by Medication Dispensed unless otherwise specified in **SortControl.** |
| Based on Segment Pattern: |  |

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input Parameter (Query ID=Z85) | Comp. Name | DT | Description |
| **MessageQueryName** |  | CWE | SHALL be valued **Z85^Pharmacy Information Comprehensive^HL7nnnn**. |
| **QueryTag** |  | ST | Unique to each query message instance. |
| **PatientList** |  | CX | The combination of values for _PatientList.ID, and PatientList.AssigningAuthority,_ are intended to identify a unique entry on the PATIENT_MASTER table. The _PatientList.IdentifierTypeCode_ is useful for further filtering or to supply uniqueness in the event that the assigning authority may have more than one coding system. (The PATIENT_MASTER table contains a constraint that prevents multiple patients from being identified by the same combination of field values.) This PATIENT_MASTER entry will be searched against on the PHARMACY_DISPENSE_TRANSACTION table to retrieve the rows fulfilling the query conditions. |
|  |  |  | If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  |  |  | If one PID.3 is specified, only 1 segment pattern will be returned. |
|  | **ID** | ID | If this field, PID.3.1, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  | **Assigning Authority** | HD | If this field, PID.3.4, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  | **Identifier type code** | IS | If this field, PID.3.5, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
| **OrderControlCode** |  | ID | If this field, ORC.1, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
| **OrderingProvider** |  | XCN | If this field, ORC.12, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
| **MedicationDispensed** |  | CWE | If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
| **DispenseDate.LL** |  | DTM | This is the earliest value to be returned for Date/Time Dispensed. If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
| **DispenseDate.UL** |  | DTM | This is the latest value to be returned for Date/Time Dispensed. If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
