#### 5.6.3.4 Message fragmentation example

Query responses, like unsolicited updates, may need to force the continuation of a message, or even a segment, across multiple physical messages. This is more precisely described as fragmenting. Fragmentation is discussed in detail in Chapter 2. Those aspects pertaining to how this would apply to a query response are repeated here for the readerâ€™s convenience.

The Client requests the last chest x-ray for the patient whose medical record number is 555444222111. The following query is submitted.

MSH|^~\&|CIS||RAD||199910180900-0700||QBP^Q61^QBP_Q11|7777|P|2.7|

QPD|Q61^Radiology Result^HL7nnnn|Q98|555444222111^^^^MR|

RCP|I|

The Server returns the following response but the OBX segment that contains a DICOM image overflows its buffer. The segment is fragmented as follows:

MSH|^~\&|RAD||CIS||||RSP^K61^RSP_K61|5555|P|2.8|

MSA|AA|7777|

QAK|Q98|OK|Q61^Radiology Result^HL7nnnn|

QPD|Q61^Radiology Result^HL7nnnn|Q98|555444222111^^^^MR|

PID|||5554442221111^^^^MR|

The Client returns an ACK upon receipt of the response.

MSH|^~\&|CIS||RAD||||ACK^K61^ACK|7780|P|2.8|

MSA|AA|5555|

The Server sends the following continued response. Note that the ADD segment will contain the remainder of the data from the fragmented segment. The response then continues on as normal.

MSH|^~\&|RAD||CIS||||RSP^K61^RSP_K61|5560|P|2.7||99|

The Client returns an ACK upon receipt of the response.
