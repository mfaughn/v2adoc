**QPD Input Parameter Field Description and Commentary**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input Parameter (Query ID=Z99) | Comp. Name | DT | Description |
| MessageQueryName |  | CWE | SHALL be valued **Z99^WhoAmI^HL7nnnn**. |
| QueryTag |  | ST | Unique to each query message instance. |
| PatientList |  | CX |  |
|  |  |  | Components: &lt;ID (ST)> ^ &lt;check digit (ST)> ^ &lt;code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)> ^ &lt; assigning authority (HD)> ^ &lt;identifier type code (IS)> ^ &lt; assigning facility (HD)> |
|  |  |  | The combination of values for _PatientID, and PatientIDAssigningAuthority,_ are intended to identify a unique entry on the PATIENT_MASTER table. The PatientIDTypeCode is useful for further filtering or to supply uniqueness in the event that the assigning authority may have more than one coding system. (The PATIENT_MASTER table contains a constraint that prevents multiple patients from being identified by the same combination of field values.) This PATIENT_MASTER entry will be searched against on the PHARMACY_DISPENSE_TRANSACTION table to retrieve the rows fulfilling the query conditions. |
|  |  |  | If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  |  |  |  |
|  | ID | ST | If this field, PID.3.1, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  | Assigning Authority | HD | If this field, PID.3.4, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  | Identifier Type Code | CWE | If this field, PID.3.5, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |

| 2 | Quantity Limited Request |  | 10 | CQ |  |
|  |  | Quantity |  | NM | Number of units (specified by the following component) that will be returned in each increment of the response. If no value is given, the entire response will be returned in a single increment. |
|  |  | Units |  | CWE | ***CH****aracters, **LI****nes, **P****a****G****es, or **R****ecor****D****s. Default is *LI**. |
| 3 | Response Modality |  | 60 | CWE | ***R****eal time or **B****atch. Default is *R**. |
| 6 | Sort-by Field |  | 256 | SRT |  |
|  |  | Sort-by Field |  | ST | Segment field name of an output column by which the response may be sorted. SHALL contain a **Y** in the Sort column of the output specification table. |
|  |  | Sequencing |  | ID | As specified in HL7 Table 0397- Sequencing. Default is ***A***scending. |
