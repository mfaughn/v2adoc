The Virtual Table Field Description and Commentary provides a more detailed description of each of the fields listed in the Virtual Table.

**Virtual Table Field Description and Commentary**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ColName (Query ID=Znn) | Comp. Name | DT | Description |
|  |  |  |  |

**ColName**: The name used to identify the column, or field, in the complex expression.

**Comp. Name**: When the **ColName** is of a composite data type (e.g., XPN), this is the name of an individual component of the column. Only those components that may be valued should be listed.

When specifying a field in the complex expression, both the **ColName** and **Comp. Name** attributes should be sent if only a single component is being identified. For instance, **PatientList.ID** would specify the ID component of the **PatientList** field.

**DT**: The data type of the field or component.

**Description**: A narrative description of the field or component and how it is to be used.
