#### 5.3.2.1 Steps for developing a Query Profile

> 1) Before composing the Query Profile, express the query in ordinary English sentences.
>
> 2) Transform the query into a mathematical or pseudo-language statement. A syntax such as SQL provides a useful mechanism.
>
> 3) From the pseudo-statement, extract the parameters and the operations upon the parameters.
>
> 4) Advertise the parameters in the Query Profile.
>
> 5) Within the Query Profile, explain the operations that will be performed upon the parameters: relational conjunctions, equality/inequality, etc. Use examples to aid the user in understanding how the query might be invoked in specific instances.
