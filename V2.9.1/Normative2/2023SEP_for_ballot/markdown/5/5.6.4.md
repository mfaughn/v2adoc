### 5.6.4 Batch message as a query response

The HL7 query also can be used to query for a batch in the following manner:

a) Use the value B of _RCP-3-Response modality_ to specify a batch response.

**Note:** If using old style query mode, the value BB or BL of _QRD-5-Deferred response type_ may be used to specify a batch response. The query will be acknowledged with a general acknowledgment as in the Deferred Access example above

b) In addition, insert into the batch file the query defining and RCP segments as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| [FHS] | (file header segment) |
| \{ |  |
| [BHS] | (batch header segment) |
| QPD | Query defining segment Note: if using old style query mode, the QRD and QRF segments may be used. |
| [RCP] |  |
| \{ |  |
| MSH | (one or more HL7 messages) |
| .... |  |
| .... |  |
| .... |  |
| } |  |
| [BTS] | (batch trailer segment) |
| } |  |
| [FTS] | (file trailer segment) |

c) The acknowledgment of a batch is described in Chapter 2.

d) The Query Profile should stipulate if the batch modality is supported.
