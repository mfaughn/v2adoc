## 5.11 OUTSTANDING ISSUES

It is not clear that there is a good use case for the super segment pattern as described in the example in section _5.9.1.2.1_, "_Comprehensive pharmacy information Query Profile_."

As currently written the usage and naming of segment groups is not clear:

> 1. Can a segment group name refer to more than one structure?
>
> 2. Can the same structure have more than one segment group name?

This has implications for table 0391, the segment group table, which is an itemization of the segment group names.
