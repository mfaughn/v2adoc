#### 5.5.6.6 RCP-6 Sort-by Field (SRT) 01624 

Components: &lt;Sort-by Field (ST)> ^ &lt;Sequencing (ID)>

Definition: For queries requesting a tabular response, this field specifies by which fields the response is to be sorted, and the order(s) in which sorting is to be performed. When the QSC variant is not in use, the values specified for the first component in this field are derived from the ColName field of the Output Specification and Commentary; see section _5.3.3.1_, "_Query Profile template for query with tabular response_." When the QSC variant is used, the values are derived from the ColName field of the Input/Output Specification and Commentary; see section _5.9.4.1_, "_Pharmacy example_" for an example.

Each repetition of this field specifies a single sort field. Thus, the first repetition of this field specifies the primary sort field; the second repetition specifies the secondary sort field; etc.
