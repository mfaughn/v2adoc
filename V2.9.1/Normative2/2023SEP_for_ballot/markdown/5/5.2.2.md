### 5.2.2 Evolution of the query standard

The Query Standard, like the HL7 Standard in general, has been evolving since its inception in Version 2.1. Version 2.4 introduced a new methodology intended to supersede the previous generation of queries.

**Original Mode Queries**

Originally, the parameters of an HL7 query were carried by the QRD and QRF segments. Because these segments were intended to be used by all queries, the content of these segments could only be loosely defined. Such "original mode queries" actually represent just a starting point for defining queries.

In these original mode queries, separate trigger events were used to differentiate between an immediate response and a deferred response. In addition, some of the functional chapters defined queries and responses with separate trigger events.

**Enhanced Mode Queries**

In HL7 v 2.3, "enhanced mode queries" were introduced that attempted to provide for a much higher level of precision in queries. Four new ways of specifying a query were introduced in Version 2.3.

An Embedded Query Language query, which supports free-form select statements, based on the query language of choice (e.g., SQL)

a Virtual Table request query which supports queries against server database tables (virtual or actual) based on specific selection criteria

a stored procedure request, which enables an application on one system to execute a stored procedure on another system, which is coded to extract specific data

an event replay request message, which is used to request data formatted as an event replay response

"Enhanced Mode" introduced three new ways to pass data to the responding system (e.g., a Server).

> 1) Passing values to specific parameters of a query. (Used by the stored procedure and event replay queries.) This is the most common and straightforward technique for creating queries. The drawback is that the client is tightly limited in the range of queries it can formulate.
>
> 2) Passing the query as a single complex query "expression". (Used by the Virtual Table query.) The query is defined by an expression-tree made up of the usual AND OR, '&lt;' , '>', ... Operators can refer to column names or variables defined by the Server. These Queries give the Client significant flexibility in specifying their query over the columns that the Server has permitted. The cost of this Client flexibility is that the Server SHALL evaluate the query expression, rather than simply plug parameter values into an existing stored procedure.
>
> 3) Passing the query as a single string in an existing database query language such as SQL. (Used by the EQL External Query Language query.) An EQL query is represented as a string formatted in the particular syntax of an existing query language. The Server will probably pass this string expression directly to an existing database engine to evaluate the query, which will have to parse this expression to recover the query. The drawback of this technique is that different database engines use different query languages, and so the exact query string which the Client constructs will depend on the Serverâ€™s query language.

Also in Version 2.3, the use of the trigger event was moving closer to the definition set forth in chapter 2. Each offered query had its own trigger event. In Version 2.3.1 each response had its own trigger event.

**Version 2.4 Queries**

Users of v 2.3 queries encountered some somewhat arbitrary limitations suggested by the v 2.3 standard. A close reading of the v 2.3 virtual table query wording made it appear that the only way a query could be specified by a QSC selection expression was if it returned tabular (RDT) results, and it seemed that query-by-parameter queries could not return tabular results.

Versions of the HL7 standard after v 2.3.1 more cleanly separate how a query is specified from how the data is returned, and they emphasize the existence of a "Conformance Statement." HL7 continues to support the semantics of the Stored Procedure/Event Replay queries and the Virtual Table queries, but formulates the syntax more clearly using a single new query, the Query By Parameter (QBP).

The QBP query is intended to unify the semantics of the stored-procedure, event-replay and virtual-table queries within the framework of a precise conformance statement.

The standard recognizes the continued use of the Original Mode queries (QRD/QRF), but uses a new query formalism to explain their semantics more clearly.

The bulk of the new material after Version 2.3.1 consists of defining a format for Conformance Statements, and giving examples of query design and use.

**Note:** Version 2.5 introduced a new, use-case-based mechanism for conformance in Section 2.12 of Chapter 2. Query implementers are encouraged to review and, where appropriate, adopt the profiling structures outlined in that section. Conformance Statement structures introduced in Version 2.4 have been renamed Query Profiles.

**Compatibility with past versions**

For backward compatibility, both the "original" and "enhanced" queries remain in the standard, but their description has been relegated to a "for backward compatibility only" section. The main part of this chapter is a complete and consistent explanation of the recommended approach to HL7 queries in Version 2.4 and later.

As in versions of the standard prior to 2.4, the detailed domain content of the query and response messages is defined by the technical committees responsible for the functionally-specific chapters; the basic forms and methodology for queries and responses are defined in this chapter.

Sections _5.2.4_, "_Response format_," and _5.2.5_, "_Query specification formats_," discuss Response Formats and Query Specification Formats.
