**Input Parameter Field Description and Commentary**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input Parameter (Query ID=Z81) | Comp. Name | DT | Description |
| **MessageQueryName** |  | CWE | SHALL be valued **Z81^Dispense History^HL7nnnn**. |
| **QueryTag** |  | ST | Unique to each query message instance. |
| **PatientList** |  | CX | The combination of values for _PatientList.ID, and PatientList.AssigningAuthority,_ are intended to identify a unique entry on the PATIENT_MASTER table. The _PatientList.IdentifierTypeCode_ is useful for further filtering or to supply uniqueness in the event that the assigning authority may have more than one coding system. (The PATIENT_MASTER table contains a constraint that prevents multiple patients from being identified by the same combination of field values.) This PATIENT_MASTER entry will be searched against on the PHARMACY_DISPENSE_TRANSACTION table to retrieve the rows fulfilling the query conditions. |
|  |  |  | If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  |  |  | If one PID.3 is specified, only 1 segment pattern will be returned. |
|  | **ID** | ID | If this field, PID.3.1, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  | **Assigning Authority** | HD | If this field, PID.3.4, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  | **Identifier type code** | CWE | If this field, PID.3.5, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
| **MedicationDispensed** |  | CWE | If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
| **DispenseDate.LL** |  | DTM | This is the earliest value to be returned for Date/Time Dispensed. If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
| **DispenseDate.UL** |  | DTM | This is the latest value to be returned for Date/Time Dispensed. If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
