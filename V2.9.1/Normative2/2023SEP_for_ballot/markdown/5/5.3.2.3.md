The Query Profile shows a query grammar. This is a brief model of the segments used in the query message.

**Query Grammar**: This and the following column specify the HL7 code name and full name of each segment sent in the query. Braces specify that the segment or segment group is repeatable; brackets specify the optionality of the segment or segment group.

**Section Reference**: Specifies where in the standard further information about the segment can be found.

When the Query by Example variant is used, the Query Grammar shows the segments that may be used to transmit parameters and the order in which they appear. Segments used to transmit parameters are always sent immediately following the QPD segment.
