#### 5.9.2.4 Lab results history Query Profile

The "Lab Results History" query returns laboratory results information in the form of the Segment Pattern Response corresponding to the ORU^R01 – unsolicited transmission of an observation message. It returns all of the results which meet the criteria defined in the QPD – Query Parameter Definition Segment of the RSP^R11 – Segment Pattern Response message.

**Input Parameter Field Description and Commentary**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input Parameter (Query ID=Z89) | Comp. Name | DT | Description |
| **PatientList** |  | CX | The combination of values for _PatientList.ID, and PatientList.AssigningAuthority,_ are intended to identify a unique entry on the PATIENT_MASTER table. The _PatientList.IdentifierTypeCode_ is useful for further filtering or to supply uniqueness in the event that the assigning authority may have more than one coding system. (The PATIENT_MASTER table contains a constraint that prevents multiple patients from being identified by the same combination of field values.) |
|  |  |  | If this field is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  |  |  | If one PID.3 is specified, only 1 segment pattern will be returned. |
|  | **ID** | ID | If this field, PID.3.1, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  | **Assigning Authority** | HD | If this field, PID.3.4, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
|  | **Identifier type code** | CWE | If this field, PID.3.5, is not valued, all values for this field are considered to be a match. |
| **Result Report Time.LL** |  | DTM | The earliest date and time for which results are to be returned. If this field is not valued, the earliest results that conform to the other query parameters will be returned. |
| **Result Report Time.UL** |  | DTM | The latest date and time for which results are to be returned. If this field is not valued, the latest results that conform to the other query parameters will be returned. |
| **LabDept** |  | CWE | The section(s) or department(s) of the laboratory reporting the results. As many **LabDept** values may be specified as desired. If this field is not valued, results that conform to the other query parameters from all sections or departments will be returned. |
| **LOINCCode** |  | CWE | The LOINC identifier for the results to be reported. As many **LOINCCode** values may be specified as desired. If this field is not valued, results that conform to the other query parameters for all LOINC codes will be returned. |

**RCP Response Control Parameter Field Description and Commentary**

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field Seq (Query ID=Z89) | Name | Com­po­nent Name | LEN | DT | Description |
| 1 | Query Priority |  | 1 | ID | (**D**)eferred or (**I**)mmediate. Default is **I**. |
| 2 | Quantity Limited Request |  | 10 | CQ |  |
|  |  | Quantity |  | NM | Number of units (specified by the following component) that will be returned in each increment of the response. If no value is given, the entire response will be returned in a single increment. |
|  |  | Units |  | CWE | ***CH****aracters, **LI****nes, **P****a****G****es, or **R****ecor****D****s. Default is *LI**. |
| 3 | Response Modality |  | 60 | CWE | ***R****eal time or **B****atch. Default is *R**. |
| 7 | Segment group inclusion |  | 256 | ID | What segment group(s) are to be included. If this field is not valued, all segment groups will be included. |

If a LOINC code is used as one of the operands of the input specification expression, all of the other OBX segments which are part of the same OBR as the selected OBX will be returned along with the selected OBX. In other words, if an OBX segment that is part of a panel is selected by the query, the entire panel will be returned.
