#### 5.2.4.4 Choosing among available response formats

In practice, it is easy to decide which style of data to offer. In general, segment pattern responses are able to carry complex data structures (e.g., an entire laboratory report) while tabular responses are typically simple data structures. Therefore, tabular response is intended as a simpler tool to accomplish a simpler task. There is no need for the Client to understand, parse and process the deep structure and relationships implied by the segment pattern response. The Client does not need a complex state machine to do segment level parsing. The rows all have the same structure so only a simple state machine is needed.

If the query is defined by an HL7 technical committee, then the decision is already made. If, on the other hand, no query is yet defined but the domain of the data is well covered by HL7, then it is probable that there are existing HL7 segments that could carry the data. A Z query may be constructed out of the existing HL7 segments. If the data is site specific, the site can either create its own Z segments and offer a segment pattern response (which makes particular sense if the overall data is complex) or it can define its own Virtual Table, offer a tabular response and let the Client process each record.

Once it is known what data a Server is making available, then the data can be ordered or requested. This is analogous to needing to refer to a catalog before ordering an item by mail.
