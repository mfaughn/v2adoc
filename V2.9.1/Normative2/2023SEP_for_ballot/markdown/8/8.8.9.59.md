#### 8.8.9.59 OM1-59 Age Restriction (NR) 03440

Components: &lt;Low Value (NM)> ^ &lt;High Value (NM)>

Definition: This field is used to convey age restrictions for ordering the test specified in OM1-2 Producerâ€™s Service/Test/Observation ID. If there are no restrictions the field is left empty. If the test is restricted to order for certain age(s), the age range restriction(s) are listed in years. For example, newborn tests are typically restricted to age 1 year or below, thus for newborn tests the field would be valued 0^1.
