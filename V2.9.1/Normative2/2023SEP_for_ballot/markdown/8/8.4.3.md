### 8.4.3 MFN/MFK - Master File Notification - Site Defined (Event M14) 

The MFN Site defined master file notification transaction is used where the master file is not a simple one (as defined for MFN^M13) and is not a transaction type currently defined by HL7, but rather requires one or more HL7 and/or 'Z' segments to carry the master file information.

The Site defined master file notification is defined as follows:
