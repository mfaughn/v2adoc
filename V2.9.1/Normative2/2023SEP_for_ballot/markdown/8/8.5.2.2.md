#### 8.5.2.2 MFE-2 MFN Control ID (ST) 00665

Definition: A number or other identifier that uniquely identifies this change to this record from the point of view of the originating system. When returned to the originating system via the MFA segment, this field allows the target system to precisely identify which change to this record is being acknowledged. It is only required if the MFI response level code requires responses at the record level (any value other than NE).

**Note:** Note that this segment does not contain a Set ID field. The _MFE-2 - MFN Control ID_ implements a more general concept than the Set ID. It takes the place of the SET ID in the MFE segment.
