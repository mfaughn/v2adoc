Definition: This field is used in conjunction with a MFE-1 Record-Level Event Code 'MDC' defined as: "Deactivate: discontinue using record in master file, but do not delete from database", in conjunction with an OM1 segment providing detail for the deactivate code. When the OM1-2 Producer’s Service/Test/Observation ID is being deactivated, use OM1-52 to indicate the producer’s replacement test or observation code(s), as it was defined in the OM1-2 Producer’s Service/Test/Observation ID when the new/replacement code was added. Refer to Table 0646 - Replacement Producer’s Service/Test/Observation ID in Chapter 2C for valid values.

**Note:** Replacement codes referenced by OM1-52 must be added to the receiver’s system before sending a deactivate record for the code being obsoleted. The Sequence is illustrated below:

Sequence 1 – Activate new code

OM1-2 Adding a new code X; Example: X^New Code X^L

OM1-52 Empty

Sequence 2 – Deactive obsolete code and indicate it’s new replacement code

OM1-2 obsolete code: Examle: Y^Deactivated code^L

OM1-52 X^New Code X^L

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **File-Level Event** **MFI-3** | **Record-Level Event** **MFE-1** | **Comment** |
| REP | MAD – Add record to master file | Note: If the _MFI-3 - File-Level Event Code_ is "REP" (replace file), then each MFE segment must have an _MFE-1 - Record-Level Event Code_ of "MAD" (add record to master file). |
| UPD | MAD – Add record to master file | (MFI-3) UPD means that the events are defined according to the record-level event code contained in each MFE segment in that message. |
| UPD | MDC – Deactivate: discontinue using record in master file, but do not delete from database | (MFI-3) UPD means that the events are defined according to the record-level event code contained in each MFE segment in that message. |
| UPD | MAC – Reactivate deactivated record | (MFI-3) UPD means that the events are defined according to the record-level event code contained in each MFE segment in that message. |
