Definition: This optional attribute allows master files to classify observations as measuring the patientâ€™s state at a point in time (e.g., spot urines, random urines, serum potassium), or averaged over an interval of time (e.g., concentration, total amount, or clearance over a 24-hour collection). Interval measures most often apply to urine and stool specimens (e.g., 24-hour urines, 3-day stool fats). They also apply to clinical measurements such as urine outputs, which are reported as shift totals and 24-hour totals, and event counts on physiologic monitors such as the number of PVCs on a 24-hour Holter monitor.

This field would only be valued in a transaction if the service sending this master file message classified its observation by point versus time interval. This field is **not** used to record the time collection interval for a particular sample. It is used to specify a characteristic of an observation which has a defined normal range and to distinguish observations of the same kind but observed over varying periods of time. A spot urine sodium would have PT stored in this field. A 24-hour urine sodium and a 24-hour Holter monitor would have 24H stored here. This attribute would only be valued if the filling service classified its observations by timing.
