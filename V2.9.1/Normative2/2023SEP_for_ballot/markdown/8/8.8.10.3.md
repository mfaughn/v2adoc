#### 8.8.10.3 OM2-3 Range of Decimal Precision (NM) 00628

Definition: This field contains the numerically valued single observations (code A or C as described in _OM1-18 - Nature of Service/Test/Observation_), specifies the total length in characters of the field needed to display the observation, and the number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal point. This is coded as a single number in the format &lt;length>.&lt;decimal-digits>. For example, a value of 6.2 implies 6 characters total (including the sign and decimal point) with 2 digits after the decimal point. For integer values, the period and &lt;decimal-digits> portion may be omitted (that is, 5.0 and 5 are equivalent). More than one such mask may be transmitted (separated by repeat delimiters) when it is necessary to define multiple display formats that are possible.
