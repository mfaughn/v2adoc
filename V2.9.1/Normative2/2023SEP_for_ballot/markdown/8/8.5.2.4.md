#### 8.5.2.4 MFE-4 Primary Key Value - MFE (Varies) 00667

Definition: This field uniquely identifies the record of the master file (identified in the MFI segment) to be changed (as defined by the record-level event code). The data type of field is defined by the value of _MFE-5 - Value Type_, and may take on the format of any of the HL7 data types defined in file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70355[HL7 Table 0355 - Primary Key Value Type] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables. The PL data type is used only on Location master transactions. Refer to Table 0608 - Primary Key Value - MFE in Chapter 2C for valid values.

The repetition of the primary key permits the identification of an individual component of a complex record as the object of the record-level event code. This feature allows the Master Files protocol to be used for modifications of single components of complex records. If this field repeats, the field _MFE-5 - Value Type_ must also repeat (with the same number of repetitions), and the data type of each repetition of _MFE-4 - Primary Key Value - MFE_ is specified by the corresponding repetition of _MFE-5 - Value Type_.
