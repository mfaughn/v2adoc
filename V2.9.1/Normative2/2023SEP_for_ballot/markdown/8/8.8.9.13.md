Definition: When applicable, this field identifies the instrument or device that is used to generate this observation or battery. Examples are the automated instrument in the laboratory, the imaging device and model number in radiology, and the automatic blood pressure machine on the ward. The instrument is specified as a coded entry in anticipation that these identifiers could be specified as codes. Initially, we expect that most of the information about devices will be transmitted as text in the second component of the CWE identifier. If more than one kind of instrument is used, all of them can be listed, separated by repeat delimiters. Refer to Table 0633 - Identity of Instrument Used to Perform this Study in Chapter 2C for valid values.
