Definition: This field contains an optional string that defines the preferred header under which this observation should be listed on a standard display. For example, if the test is hemoglobin, this string might be "Complete blood count." It is represented as a coded data type so that a battery can be a header. Only the description part of the string may be included in case the subheader does not have an associated code. When a series of observations is displayed according to the sort order given below, the subheader that groups those observations is presented whenever the subheader changes. Refer to Table 0637 - Report Subheader in Chapter 2C for valid values.
