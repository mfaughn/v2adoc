## 13.6 Outstanding Issues

The element definition for TCC-15 Test Criticality in section 13.4.9.15 proposes an ambigous use of the CWE data type in. Currently the element definition indicates that a CWE data type is used; however, the definition also advises that the element can be populated with "a sequential number of the test sorted according to the criticality assigned by the lab". In general practice, the CWE data type references a table of assigned values, recognizing that those values are often assigned by the user. It is expected that the definition for this element will be reviewed and revised with the next release.
