### 13.4.3 Transfer of QC Results

Use _SPM-11 Specimen Role_, or _SAC-6 Specimen Source_, or the 7th component of _OBR-15 Specimen Source_ or _SAC-6 Specimen Source_ to indicate that this is a control specimen. Use _SAC-3 Container Identifier_ for the identification of a control specimen container. The SID segment appended to this SAC segment specifies the manufacturer, lot identifiers, etc. for the control specimen.

The identification of the instrument performing the QC measurement, should be transferred with the _OBX-18 Equipment Instance Identifier_), the measurement data/time with the _OBX-19 Date/Time of the Analysis_.
