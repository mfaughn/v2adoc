### 13.2.14 INR/ACK â€“ Automated Equipment Inventory Request (Event U14)

> This message is used to request information about inventory items from one application to another (e.g., Laboratory Automation System to automated equipment). The equipment specified in the EQU segment should respond with the information about inventory item requested in the INV segment (or all items).
>
> Compared to INR^U06, it declares INV as optional and does not require fields INV-1 and INV-2 there. In that way, it supports queries for all inventory items without filtering on any attributes.
