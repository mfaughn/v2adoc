Definition: This field is the physical location that the specimen was at the time that the transaction was initiated. The location description can vary with the LAS. For example, it can be an X,Y,Z coordinate in a storage system; a refrigerator number and drawer number where the container-carrier-tray is located; or it can be the name of the institution and the laboratory which owns the container currently. The repeating of this field allows for hierarchical representation of location (lowest level first), e.g., shelf number, refrigerator storage id, lab name, institution name, etc. Refer to Table 0774 - Location in Chapter 2C for valid values.
