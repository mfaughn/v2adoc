### 13.1.2 Introduction

This chapter specifies HL7 triggers, messages, and segments required for implementation of clinical laboratory automation communication interfaces. It was developed jointly by the HL7 Laboratory Automation Special Interest Group and the NCCLS Subcommittee on Communications with Automated Systems. This chapter, by agreement between HL7 and NCCLS, is also published in its entirety as part of the NCCLS Approved Level standard:

• AUTO3, "Laboratory Automation: Communications with Automated Clinical Laboratory Systems, Instruments, Devices, and Information Systems, © NCCLS" footnote:[(NCCLS. _Laboratory Automation: Communications With Automated Clinical Laboratory Systems, Instruments, Devices, and Information Systems_; Approved Standard - NCCLS Document AUTO3-A [ISBN 1-56238-361-2}. NCCLS, 940 West Valley Road, Suite 1400, Wayne, PA 19087-1898 USA, 2000). www.nccls.org]

This document contains other chapters to enable a vendor to successfully implement all of the elements essential to meet the standard.
