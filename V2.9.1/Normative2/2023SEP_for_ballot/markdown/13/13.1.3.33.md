The information system that is responsible for management of data regarding patient specimen identification, tests requested, results reported, quality control testing, and other aspects of sample analysis.

b) Instrument or specimen processing and handling devices may be interfaced with the LIS or the LAS to direct specific testing and to retrieve results for reporting;

c) The LIS is frequently also interfaced to a clinical information system for use by physicians and other medical personnel.
