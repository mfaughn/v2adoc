### 13.2.7 EAC/ACK â€“ Automated Equipment Command (Event U07)

This message is used to send equipment commands from one application to another (e.g., a Laboratory Automation System to automated Equipment). The OBR segments attached to the SAC should be used for transfer of information about tests assigned to a specific aliquot in the aliquoting command (not included in the SAC segment, but relevant for automating processing).

The repeatability of the DST segment should be used for multiple destinations in sequence and the remark may be used as additional information, e.g. for destination dependent bar code labels for the secondary (aliquot) containers.

The repeatability of the Specimen Container block enables sending commands for Pooling specimen (multiple sources) from a Primary Specimen. Command for multiple aliquots requires specific Command group for each aliquot.
