#### 11.2.2.4 The querying application role

A querying application neither exerts control over, nor requests changes to a referral. Rather than accepting unsolicited information about referrals, as does an auxiliary application, the querying application actively solicits this information using a query mechanism. It will, in general, be driven by an entity seeking information about a referral such as a referring provider application or an entity seeking information about a referred patient such as a referred-to provider application. The information that the querying application receives is valid only at the exact time that the query results are generated by the provider applications. Changes made to the referral or the referred patient’s status after the query results have been returned are not communicated to the querying application until it issues another query transaction.

The analog of a querying application in a non‑automated environment might be a primary care provider seeking information about a specific patient who has been referred to a specialist. For example, a patient may have been referred to a specialist in order that a specific test be performed, following which, the patient would return to the primary care provider. If the specialist has not forwarded information regarding the testing procedures for the patient to the primary care provider, the primary care provider would then query the specialist for the outcome of those procedures. Likewise, if a specialist received a referred patient without the preliminary diagnoses of test results, he/she might in turn query the primary care provider for the information leading to the diagnoses and subsequent referral.
