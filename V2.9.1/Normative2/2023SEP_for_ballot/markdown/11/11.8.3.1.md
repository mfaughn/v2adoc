Definition: This field contains the contact role that defines the relationship of the person or organization described in this segment to the patient being referred. When a referral is inter-enterprise in nature, there are several important relationships that must be identified. For example, the proper identification of both the referring and the referred-to provider is critical for proper processing of a referral. In addition, some enterprises may want information regarding a consulting provider or the identity of the person who actually prepared the referral. This contact role may also expand to represent affiliated persons to whom information regarding this referral must be forwarded or copied.
