**Note**: The abstract message definitions for both the RPA and RQA include the patient visit segments (PV1 and PV2). The PV1 and PV2 segments appear in the RPA and RQA as an optional grouping to specify the visit or encounter that generated the referral authorization request. The PV1 and PV2 should not be used to provide suggested information for a future encounter or visit generated by the referral authorization request.

The trigger events that use this message definition are described in sections _11.4.2_, "_RQA/RPA – Request for Treatment Authorization Information (Event I08)_," through _11.4.5_, "_RQA/RPA - Request for Cancellation of an Authorization (Event I11)_."
