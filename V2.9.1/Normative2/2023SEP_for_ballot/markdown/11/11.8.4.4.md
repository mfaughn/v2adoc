Definition: This field contains the location of the contact, which is required when a contact that may be external to a given enterprise must be referenced. For example, if this contact represents the office manager of the referred-to physician, then the contact location should identify the clinic of the physician or provider to whom this referral has been sent. An application and facility identifier carried in the facility field specifies the identification of the contact’s location. The application identifier and the facility identifier would be used in the same manner as their corresponding fields in the MSH segment (_MSH-3-Sending application, MSH-5-Receiving application, MSH-4-Sending facility, MSH-6-Receiving facility_). That is, the facility field will contain an application identifier and facility identifier which describe the location of this contact. However, it should be noted that they may describe a different location because the contact location being referenced in this field _may not be_ the location from which the message originated, which is being described by the MSH.
