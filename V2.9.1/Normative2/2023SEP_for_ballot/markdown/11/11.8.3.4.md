Definition: This field contains the location of the provider as needed when a provider that may be external to a given enterprise must be referenced. For example, if this provider represented the referred-to physician, the _PRD-4-Provider location_ should identify the clinic of the physician or provider to whom this referral has been sent. An application and facility identifier carried in the facility field specifies the identification of the provider’s location. The application ID and facility ID would be used in the same manner as their corresponding fields in the MSH segment (_MSH-3-Sending application, MSH-5-Receiving application,_ _MSH-4-Sending facility, MSH-6-Receiving facility_). That is, the facility field will contain an application identifier and facility identifier which describe the location of this provider. However, it should be noted that they may describe a different location because the provider location being referenced in this field _may not be_ the location from which the message originated, which is being described by the MSH.
