## 12.7 Outstanding Issues

In both the Problem and Goal segments a field named "Episode of Care" has been included. This field is intended to accommodate an entity defined by consensus business rules that defines an episode of care.

Individual businesses/applications must be cognizant of and able to handle data integrity issues that may arise from the fact that problem lists and goal lists may not have a single owner of record. This chapter does not address the need for joint data ownership (of problem and goal data) between two or more front-end clinical applications concurrently supporting patient care in real-time. From a data integrity perspective, problem/goal data must be sourced/originated (and thus owned) by a single application only - for example, a front-end clinical application (source) transmitting to a back-end repository application. This is not recognized to be within the current scope of the Patient Care Committee; therefore, this concern will be submitted to the Infrastructure & Messaging committee for further debate.
