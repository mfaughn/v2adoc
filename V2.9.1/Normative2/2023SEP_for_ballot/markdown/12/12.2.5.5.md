#### 12.2.5.5 Rule 5

The Problem, Goal, and Pathway messages integrate order segments as a method for establishing causal linkages. Linkages or relationships between orders, problems, goals, and pathways can therefore be presented in the Patient Care messages.

Orders referenced in Patient Care messages are used for linkage purposes only. Initiation and status changes to orders are accomplished by using dedicated messages defined in the Order Entry Chapter.
