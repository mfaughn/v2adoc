### 12.2.4 Use of Action Codes 

Prior to Version 2.3 of the Standard, all repeating segments had to be sent in an update message, because there was no way to indicate which ones changed and which ones did not. In this **snapshot** mode, all repeating segments must be sent with every subsequent message in the series of messages.

To reduce the number of repeating segments, action codes may be employed. Action codes (e.g., order control codes and result status codes) may be embedded within repeating segments and used by sophisticated application parsers to reduce the number of repetitions required for a complete record.

In either event, for systems implementing Version 2.3 or higher, if a particular repeating segment can be updated by either of these two modes, the parties concerned determine by agreement on a site-specific basis whether an interface uses the **snapshot** mode or the **action code/unique identifier** mode.

A description of valid action codes used in message segments originating in this chapter is given immediately below:

a) **AD** (**ADD**) - The object defined within the segment should be added to the set of objects that is linked to the previous object in the hierarchical structure of the message. (i.e., a goal under a problem is implicitly linked to the problem. If the goals already exist, the segment placement indicates the addition of a new linkage between the goal and that problem.)

b) **CO** (**CORRECT**) - The object attributes contained within the segment have been corrected. This is not updated information, but information originally sent and later found to be in error. The previous attributes should be replaced.

c) **UP** (**UPDATE**) - The object attributes contained within the segment are an update of previously sent information. The previous information was correct for the period of time in which it was sent.

d) **DE** (**DELETE**) - This object should be deleted from the set of objects which are linked to the previous object in the message hierarchy. An example might be a role deleted from the set of roles contained by the Goal object. Delete presumes the original linkage was in error.

e) **LI (LINK)** - This action code denotes that the object contained in the segment should be linked in a dependency relationship to the previous object in the hierarchy. It is used to denote relationships and should not contain additional information other than those attributes necessary for specific identification.

f) **UN** (**UNLINK**) - This is a request that the object be removed from the set of linked objects. An example might be the dissolution of a relationship between a problem and a goal. Unlink presumes the original linkage was correct, but due to life cycle changes the active linkage is no longer appropriate.

g) **UC** (**UNCHANGED**) - This code signifies that the segment is being included for the purposes of hierarchical set identification. It does not contain any changed or additional data. Its purpose is to allow the identification of the collection set to which subsequent segments belong in the message structure. An example might be the modification of role information requiring the previous goal segment to be appropriately identified.
