## 12.6 IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

The Patient Care Technical Committee recognizes that this document contains a great deal of information for computer systems that are currently under development. The participating institutions/vendors will be responsible for defining the necessary tables that have been previously discussed. As these tables are defined and clarified, they will be included in this document for distribution.

Applications can have differing orientations for representing problem and goal hierarchies. For example, parent:child relationships may map problem(s) to goal(s), or goal(s) to problem(s). To accommodate these different orientations, the Problem message allows representation of goals that are functionally dependent upon a problem, and the Goal message allows representation of problems that are functionally dependent on a goal. We recognize that institutions will decide on one or the other of the methodologies based on practice preferences.
