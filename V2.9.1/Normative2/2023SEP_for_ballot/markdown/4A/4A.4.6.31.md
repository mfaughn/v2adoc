#### 4A.4.6.31 RXG-31 Give Tag Identifier (EI) 03393

Components: &lt;Entity Identifier (ST)> ^ &lt;Namespace ID (IS)> ^ &lt;Universal ID (ST)> ^ &lt;Universal ID Type (ID)>

Definition: This field contains an identifier for the individual product instance for the dispense occurrence. This may represent a barcode, RFID or other means of automatically-readable product instance. Repetitions represent the same instance where more than one barcode, RFID or other identification is present.

For example, the medication preparer, e.g., a semi-automated system, can inform the nurse that "for the 8.am administration event, the medication that has been assigned and available at the patient bedside has the barcode BBBBBBBBBBB." The nurse would scan the barcode to ensure that the right medication is being administered.

This differs from _RXG-25 Give Barcode Identifier_ in that RXG-25 may include other workflow content or the product at various levels of granularity. RXG-31 specifically identifies the product instance.
