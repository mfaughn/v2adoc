### 4A.2.1 Preface (organization of this chapter)

This chapter is organized into two major sections, Pharmacy, and Vaccine. Each section contains the trigger events, message definitions, segments and examples for the specific type of order messages. Each section about a type of order is organized into background and overview, message structure, and message segments (that are specific to the order class in question).

A list of allowable values for a field is included in the body of the text, along with the field definition for easier reference.
