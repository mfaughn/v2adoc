N No - No warning is present. This is the equivalent default (null) value.

An example of the use of this field is given by the following case:

A _smart_ Order Entry application knows of a possible drug or treatment interaction on a certain order, but the provider issuing the order wants to override the condition. In this case, the pharmacy or treatment application receiving the order will want to have a staff pharmacist or non-pharmacist treatment supplier review the interaction and contact the ordering physician.
