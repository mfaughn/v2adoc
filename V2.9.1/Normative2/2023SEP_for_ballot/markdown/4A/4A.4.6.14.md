#### 4A.4.6.14 RXG-14 Give Per (Time Unit) (ST) 00331

Definition: This field contains the time unit to use to calculate the rate at which the pharmaceutical/treatment is to be administered.

Format:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S&lt;integer> | = | &lt;integer> seconds |
| M&lt;integer> | = | &lt;integer> minutes |
| H&lt;integer> | = | &lt;integer> hours |
| D&lt;integer> | = | &lt;integer> days |
| W&lt;integer> | = | &lt;integer> weeks |
| L&lt;integer> | = | &lt;integer> months |
| T&lt;integer> | = | at the interval and amount stated until a total of &lt;integer> "DOSAGE" is accumulated. Units would be assumed to be the same as in the QUANTITY field. |
| INDEF | = | do indefinitely - also the default |

This is the same as the format specified for the DURATION component of the quantity/timing field, excluding the "X" specification.

Required when relevant (e.g., certain IVs). For example, if the "give amount/units" were 300 ml and the "give per" time unit were H1 (equivalent to one hour), the rate is 300ml/hr.
