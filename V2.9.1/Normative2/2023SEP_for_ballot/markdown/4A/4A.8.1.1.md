#### 4A.8.1.1 Using RXA-5 in vaccine messages

Use in _RXA-5- administered code_ to identify the particular vaccine administered. The codes listed are used by immunization by immunization registries in the U.S. Entries will be added as needed to accommodate international requirements. Refer to chapter 2C file:///E:\V2\v2.9%20final%20Nov%20from%20Frank\V29_CH02C_Tables.docx#HL70292[_Imported Table 0292 â€“ Vaccines administered_] in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid values. If CVX code is used to identify vaccines, the coding system component (RXA-5.3) should be valued as "CVX", not as "HL70292."
