#### 4A.4.4.39 RXE-39 Initial Dispense Amount (NM) 01680

Definition: This field specifies the quantity dispensed on the original fill (first fill) of a prescription when that amount is not the same as the quantity to be used in refills. One use case is when a new medication is being prescribed and the prescriber wants to determine if the patient will tolerate the medication. The prescriber indicates that the medication should be filled for an initial amount of 30 tablets and, if tolerated, refilled using a quantity of 100 tablets. In this case, RXE-39 would contain 30 and RXE-10 would contain 100.

If this field is not populated, then the initial dispense amount is the same as RXE-10.

The units are identified in RXE-11.
