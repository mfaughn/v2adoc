#### 6.5.7.27 NOTE: US Realm guidance. The term subscriber typically refers to to an individual or entity that selects benefits offered by an entity, such as an employer, government, or insurance company. In Government Social Programs such as Medicare and Medicaid enrollees are not considered subscribers and do not have dependents. However, government or commercial payers may treat these enrollees as subscribers in their systems, e.g., for coordination of benefits or providing managed care for a government program.
