Procedure Code Coding Systems (from HL7 Table 0396)

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code | Description | Comment / Source |
| C4 | CPT-4 | American Medical Association, P.O. Box 10946, Chicago IL 60610. |
| C5 | CPT-5 | (under development – same contact as above) |
| HCPCS | CMS (formerly HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System | HCPCS: contains codes for medical equipment, injectable drugs, transportation services, and other services not found in CPT4. |
| HPC | CMS (formerly HCFA )Procedure Codes (HCPCS) | Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) including modifiers.footnote:[The HCPCS code is divided into three "levels." Level I includes the entire CPT-4 code by reference. Level II includes the American Dental Association’s Current Dental Terminology (CDT-2) code by reference. Level II also includes the genuine HCPCS codes, approved and maintained jointly by the Alpha-Numeric Editorial Panel, consisting of CMS, the Health Insurance Association of America, and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. Level III are codes developed locally by Medicare carriers. The HCPCS modifiers are divided into the same three levels, I being CPT-4 modifiers, II CDT-2 and genuine HCPCS modifiers, and III being locally agreed modifiers.<br> <br> The genuine HCPCS codes and modifiers of level II can be found at http://www.hcfa.gov/stats/anhcpcdl.htm. CMS distributes the HCPCS codes via the National Technical Information Service (NTIS, [www.ntis.gov](http://www.ntis.gov)) and NTIS distribution includes the CDT-2 part of HCPCS Level II, but does not include the CPT-4 part (Level I). CMS may distribute the CPT-4 part to its contractors.] |
