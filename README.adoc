This is a collection of .docx files that have been converted to .adoc files.  It also includes Ruby code which extracts v2 artifacts from these .adoc files.  All of this is simply a stepping stone towards getting a first version of v2+ represented as a collection of computable artifacts (i.e., files).  While that collection will include .adoc files, these files aren't those files!

Given that all of this is not intended for long term use or maintainence, minimal effort is being exerted to provide extensive documentation and/or a complete set of supporting code.
